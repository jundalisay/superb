The material layer is the lowest layer in the universe and manifests as physical objects. A unit example is a rock.<!-- It solid holds crosses existence and covers up pre-existence. You can think of it as the mind of Brahma or the RAM of a computer that generates its own virtual reality. -->

In terms of creation, this layer is the final layer in the journey of dynamic energy and entropy towards stasis and is where mind is at its most dormant state.

The conversion from dormant mind into active mind then takes place in stars. In this way, both matter (dormant mind) and life (active mind) come from the explosion of stars as the expression or crossing-over of the metaphysical ideas of the Supreme Entity onto physical reality.
