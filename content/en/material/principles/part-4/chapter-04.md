Transformative Relativity explains the principles for the Transformative (Weak) Layer. In Physics, this is done by the Feynman diagrams. 


## Feynman Diagrams 

These diagrams show the interaction between 2 particles. It has the following lines:

Line | Particle
--- | ---
Straight | Fermion
Wavy | Photon 
Loop | Gluon
Dashed | W, Z Boson
