Radioactive Relativity explains the principles for the Radioactive (Weak) Layer. In Physics, this is done by the Feynman diagrams. 

## Feynman Diagrams 

These diagrams show the interaction between two particles. 

It has the following lines

Line | Particle
--- | ---
Straight | Fermion
Wavy | Photon 
Loop | Gluon
Dashed | W, Z Boson 


More to come! (This is quite complicated)
