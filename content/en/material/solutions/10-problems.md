Modern Physics is currently stuck with 10 problems, which we classify below:


## Gravity Problems

**1. Quantum Gravity**

- Cause of Problem: General Relativity and Newton
- Solution: Aethereal Vortices


**5-6. Dark Energy and Dark Matter**

- Cause of Problem: General Relativity
- Solution: Spatial Layer, Quanta of Spacetime, and Aethereal Vortices

## Particle Problems

**2. Particle Masses**

- Cause of Problem: Material Influence
- Solution: The 5 Layers and the 2 Forces


**4. Turbulence**

- Cause of Problem: Material Influence
- Solution: The 2 forces on the aether is the cause of all turbulence 


**8. The Matter-Antimatter**

- Cause of Problem: Material Influence
- Solution: The metaphysical domain


**9. Friction**

- Cause of Problem: Material Influence
- Solution: The Five Layers




## Systemic Problems


**3. The “Measurement” Problem**

- Cause of Problem: Material Influence
- Solution: Use the aether as the measure via qualimath or data science


**7. Complexity**

- Cause of Problem: Material Influence
- Solution: Use the aether as the measure via qualimath or data science



**10. The “Arrow of Time”**

- Cause of Problem: General Relativity
- Solution: The Cartesian View

As you can see, the main culprit is the super strong influence of matter on humans minds. This can only be caused by the Negative Force (Yin or Shakti). This manifests as over-quantification, selfishness, preference for material perceptions and sight. 

The general solution is to use the Postive Force (Yang or Shiva) which is represented by fellow-feeling, selflessness, preference for feelings and the heart.

The proper combination of the Negative and Positive should result in both critical thinking and critical feeling.
