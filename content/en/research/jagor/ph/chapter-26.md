The Chinese are an important portion of the population because of their contribution to the development of the land-cultivation.
- This is demanded by the increasing trade and commercial intercourse which can be effected only by Chinese industry and perseverance.

Manila has always been a favourite place for Chinese immigrants. The following have not prevented their coming:
- the hostility of the people
- the oppressive and prohibitory decrees of the <!-- gfor a long time on the part of the --> Government
- the repeated massacres

The location of the Philippine islands, south-east of 2 of the most important of the Chinese provinces, brought about a trade between the two countries very early. Ships can make the voyage in either direction with a moderate wind, as well in the south-west as the north-east monsoon. 

A few old writers even asserted that the Philippine Islands were once under the dominion of China. 

Father Gaubil (“Lettres Édifiantes') mentions that Joung-lo (of the Ming dynasty) maintained a fleet of 30,000 men, which at different times proceeded to Manila. 

The presence of this fleet as early as the arrival of Magellan<!-- in the extreme east of the archipelago -->, as well as the China plates and earthenware vessels discovered in the excavations, plainly show that the trade with China had extended far earlier to the most distant islands of the archipelago. 

It formed the chief support of the young Spanish colony, and, after the rise of the Encomiendas, was nearly the only source of its prosperity. 

It was feared that the junks would offer their cargoes to the Dutch if any obstacle was put in the way of their coming to Manila. 

The colony certainly could not maintain its position without the “Sangleyes,"'* who came annually in great numbers in the junks from China, and spread all over the country and in the towns as shopkeepers, artisans, gardeners, and fishermen ; besides which, they were the only skilful and industrious workers, as the Indians under the priestly domination had forgotten altogether many trades which they had engaged in in former times. I take these facts from Morga.

Despite this, the Spaniards have from the very start tried rigorously to limit the number of the Chinese who were then, as they are now, envied and hated by the natives for their industry, frugality, and cunning which makes them soon rich. 

To the priests, the Chinese were an abomination, irreclaimable heathens whose example prevented the natives from progressing into Christianity. 

The Government feared the strong bond of union between them. The Chinese were subjects of so powerful a nation, whose close proximity threatened the few Spaniards with destruction.† 

Fortunately for the Spaniards, the Ming dynasty at that time was collapsing. It did not think of conquest. Instead, it  wickedly disposed powers, as Limahong, to <!--  which sprang intoexistence upon their downfall brought --> bring the Philippines into extreme danger.

* The Chinese were generally known in the Philippines as “Sangleyes;" according to Professor Schott, “sang-lui (in the south szang-loi, also senng-loi) mercatorum ordo." "Sang" is more especially applied to the travelling traders, in opposition to “kú," tabernarii.

t...“They are a wicked and vicious people, and, owing to their numbers, and to their being such large eaters, they consume the provisions and render them dear. The town cannot exist without the Chinese, as they are the workers in all the trades and business, and very industrious, and work for small wages. But for that very reason a lesser number of them would be sufficient."--MORGA, p. 349.



## MASSACRE OF CHINESE


In the attack of the pirate Limahong in 1574, they escaped destruction only by a miracle. Soon, new dangers threatened them.  

In 1603, a few mandarins came to Manila, under the pretence of ascertaining whether the ground about Cavite really contained gold. They were supposed to be spies. Their mission showed that an attack on the Philippines was intended by the Chinese.

The archbishop and the priests incited the distrust which was felt against the numerous Chinese who were settled in Manila. Mutual hate and suspicion arose. Both parties feared one another and prepared for hostilities. 

The Chinese commenced the attack. But the united forces of the Spaniards were supported by the Japanese and the natives. This led to 23,000-25,000 Chinese killed or driven to the wilderness.   

When the news of this massacre reached China, a letter from the Royal Commissioners was sent to the Governor of Manila. It showed how hollow the great Government was at that time.<!--  that I have given a literal translation of it at the end of this chapter.  -->

After the extermination of the Chinese, food and all other necessaries of life were difficult to obtain on account of the utter incapacity of the natives for work. 

But by 1605 the number of Chinese * had again so increased that a decree was issued limiting them to 6,000. These were to be employed in the cultivation of the country" 

At the same time, their rapid increase was taken advantage of by the Captain-General for his own interest, as he exacted eight dollars from each Chinaman for permission to remain. 

In 1639, the Chinese population had risen to 30,000, according to other information 40,000. When they revolted and were reduced to 7,000. “The natives, who generally were so listless and indifferent, showed the utmost eagerness in assisting in the massacre of the Chinese, but more from hatred of this industrious people than from any feeling of friendship towards the Spaniards.*

<!-- * " Recopilacion," Lib. iv., Tit. xviii., ley. 1. -->

The void occasioned by this massacre was soon filled up again by Chinese immigrants; and in 1662 the colony was once more menaced with a new and great danger, by the Chinese pirate Kog-seng, who had under his command between 80,000 and 100,000 men, and who already had dispossessed the Dutch of the Island of Formosa. 

He demanded the absolute submission of the Philippines ; his sudden death, however, saved the colony, and occasioned a fresh outbreak of fury against the Chinese settlers in Manila, a great number of whom were butchered in their own “quarter” (ghetto). † Some dispersed and hid themselves; a few in their terror plunged into the water or hanged themselves ; and a great number fled in small boats to Formosa. I

In 1709 the jealousy against the Chinese once more had reached such a height that they were accused of rebellion, and particularly of monopolising the trades; and, with the exception of the most serviceable of the artisans and such of them as were employed by the Government, they were once again expelled. 

Spanish writers praise the salutariness of these measures ; alleging that “under the pretence of agriculture the Chinese carry on trade; they are cunning and careful, making money and sending it to China, so that they defraud the Philippines annually of an enormous amount.” Sonnerat, however, complains that art, trade, and commerce, had not recovered from these severe blows; though, he adds, fortunately the Chinese, in spite of prohibitory decrees, are returning through the corrupt connivance of the governor and officials. 

To the present day, they are blamed as being monopolists, particularly by the creoles. Through their steady industry and natural commercial aptitude, they have appropriated nearly all the retail trade to themselves. 

The sale of European imported goods is entirely in their hands; and the wholesale purchase of the produce of the country for export is divided between the Indians, creoles, and the Chinese, the latter taking about one half. 

Before this time, only the natives and creoles were permitted to own ships for forwarding the produce to Manila.

## SPANISH JEALOUSY

In 1757, the jealousy of the Spaniards broke out again in the form of a new order from Madrid, directing the expulsion of the Chinese. 

In 1759, the decrees of banishment, which were repeatedly evaded, were carried into effect. But, as the private interests of the officials did not happen to coincide with those of the creole traders, the consequence was “that the Chinese soon streamed back again in incredible numbers,” and made common cause with the English upon their invasion in 1762.* 

Thereupon, Señor Anda commanded “that all the Chinese in the Philippine Islands should be hanged,” which order was very generally carried out. †

The last great Chinese massacre took place in 1819, when the aliens were suspected of having brought about the cholera by poisoning the wells. The greater part of the Europeans in Manila also fell victims to the fury of the populace, but the Spaniards generally were spared.

The prejudice of the Spaniards, especially of the creoles, had always been directed against the Chinese tradesmen, who interfered unpleasantly with the profits of the natives; and against this class in particular were the laws of limitation aimed. The Chinese would willingly have given their attention to farming, were it not that the enmity of the Indians generally prevented them. 

A decree, issued in 1804, commanded all Chinese shop* See following chapter.

<!-- + Zuñiga, xvi. -->

keepers to leave Manila within eight days, only those who were married being allowed to keep shops ; and their residence in the provinces was permitted only upon the condition that they confined themselves entirely to agriculture. 

Magistrates who allowed them to leave the district over which they commanded were fined 200 dollars; the deputy-governor 25 dollars; and the wretched Chinese were punished with from two to three years' confinement in irons. In 1839 the penalties against the Chinese were somewhat mitigated, but those against the magistrates were still maintained on account of their venality.

In 1843 Chinese ships were placed upon terms of equality with those of other foreign countries (Leg. Ult., II., 476).

In 1850 Captain-General Urbiztondo endeavoured to introduce Chinese colonial farming, and with this object promised a reduction of the taxes to all agricultural immigrants. Many Chinese availed themselves of this opportunity in order to escape the heavy poll-tax; but in general they soon betook themselves to trading once more.

Of late years the Chinese have not suffered from the terrible massacres which used formerly to overtake them ; neither have they suffered banishment; the officials being content to suppress their activity by means of heavy and oppressive taxes. 

For instance, at the end of 1867 the Chinese shopkeepers were annually taxed 60 dollars for permission to send their goods to the weekly market; this was in addition to a tax of from 12 to 100 dollars on their occupations; and at the same time they were commanded thenceforth to keep their books in Spanish (English Consular Report, 1869).

The Chinese remain true to their customs and mode of living in the Philippines, as they do everywhere else. When they outwardly embrace Christianity, it is done merely to facilitate marriage, or from some motive conducive to their worldly advantage; and occasionally they renounce it, together with their wives in Manila, when about to return home to China. Very many of them, however, beget families, are excellent householders, and their children in time form the most enterprising, industrious, and wealthy portion of the resident population.
