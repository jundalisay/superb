description: "The best is from Cambodia (Chon-la). The second quality is from South Vietnam (Champa)"
---


Chon-hiang comes from different places. 

- The best is from Cambodia (Chon-la)
- The second quality is from South Vietnam (Champa)
- The poorest qualities are those of Sumatra and Java.

It is customary to distinguish between:
- Upper Coast countries: Cambodia and South Vietnam
- Lower Coast countries: Arabia, Sumatra, and Java 

This incense is:
- superior if it comes from a living tree. 
- inferior if it comes from a decayed one. 

Its shape varies widely, leading to several varieties. 

One looks like a rhinoceros horn (si-kio) and is called si-kio-chon "rhinoceros horn gharu-wood»)

Another which resembles the beak of a swallow (yen-k'ou),

Notes.
Ch'on-Mang means literally Ksinking-incensei); it is thus called because it sinks in
10 water. Its name in Malay and Javanese is Tcalambak or Manibah, but it is also known
in those
languages by that of gharu or Jcayu gharu, gharu-wood, a corruption
of the Sanskrit agaru,
which in turn is the original from which the Portuguese formed the name of
i^ao d'aguila, whence

Ibn Batuta, Voyages, IV, 242 says the best quality of lign-aloes was that of Kakulah

(their Sanf), which they called Sanfi. See Heyd, Hist, du Commerce, II, 581, 584.
According to Loureiro, Flor. Cochin., 327, gharu is a product of the Aloexylon agallochum
(the Aquilaria agalocha, Koxb.), Bretschneider, Bot. Sinic, III, 459. W. W. Skeat, Malay
