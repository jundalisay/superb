{{< sup v="21" >}}  Mary said to Jesus, "Whom are your disciples like?"

He said, "They are like children who have settled in a field which is not theirs. When the
owners of the field come, they will say, 'Let us have back our field.' They (will) undress
in their presence in order to let them have back their field and to give it back to them.

Therefore I say, if the owner of a house knows that the thief is coming, he will begin his
vigil before he comes and will not let him dig through into his house of his domain to
carry away his goods. You, then, be on your guard against the world. Arm yourselves
with great strength lest the robbers find a way to come to you, for the difficulty which
you expect will (surely) materialize. Let there be among you a man of understanding.
When the grain ripened, he came quickly with his sickle in his hand and reaped it.
Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear."

(22) Jesus saw infants being suckled. He said to his disciples, "These infants being
suckled are like those who enter the kingdom."

They said to him, "Shall we then, as children, enter the kingdom?"

Jesus said to them, "When you make the two one, and when you make the inside like the
outside and the outside like the inside, and the above like the below, and when you make
the male and the female one and the same, so that the male not be male nor the female;
and when you fashion eyes in the place of an eye, and a hand in place of a hand, and a
foot in place of a foot, and a likeness in place of a likeness; then will you enter the
kingdom."

(23) Jesus said, "I shall choose you, one out of a thousand, and two out of ten thousand,
and they shall stand as a single one."

(24) His disciples said to him, "Show us the place where you are, since it is necessary for
us to seek it."

He said to them, "Whoever has ears, let him hear. There is light within a man of light,
and he lights up the whole world. If he does not shine, he is darkness."

(25) Jesus said, "Love your brother like your soul, guard him like the pupil of your eye."

(26) Jesus said, "You see the mote in your brother's eye, but you do not see the beam in
your own eye. When you cast the beam out of your own eye, then you will see clearly to
cast the mote from your brother's eye."

{{< sup v="27" >}} "If you do not fast as regards the world, you will not find the kingdom.
If you do not observe the Sabbath as a Sabbath, you will not see the father."

(28) Jesus said, "I took my place in the midst of the world, and I appeared to them in
flesh. I found all of them intoxicated; I found none of them thirsty. And my soul became
afflicted for the sons of men, because they are blind in their hearts and do not have sight;
for empty they came into the world, and empty too they seek to leave the world. But for
the moment they are intoxicated. When they shake off their wine, then they will repent."

(29) Jesus said, "If the flesh came into being because of spirit, it is a wonder. But if spirit
came into being because of the body, it is a wonder of wonders. Indeed, I am amazed at
how this great wealth has made its home in this poverty."

(30) Jesus said, "Where there are three gods, they are gods. Where there are two or one, I
am with him."

(31) Jesus said, "No prophet is accepted in his own village; no physician heals those who
know him."

(32) Jesus said, "A city being built on a high mountain and fortified cannot fall, nor can it
be hidden."

(33) Jesus said, "Preach from your housetops that which you will hear in your ear. For no
one lights a lamp and puts it under a bushel, nor does he put it in a hidden place, but
rather he sets it on a lamp stand so that everyone who enters and leaves will see its light."

(34) Jesus said, "If a blind man leads a blind man, they will both fall into a pit."

(35) Jesus said, "It is not possible for anyone to enter the house of a strong man and take
it by force unless he binds his hands; then he will (be able to) ransack his house."

(36) Jesus said, "Do not be concerned from morning until evening and from evening until
morning about what you will wear."

(37) His disciples said, "When will you become revealed to us and when shall we see you?"

Jesus said, "When you disrobe without being ashamed and take up your garments and
place them under your feet like little children and tread on them, then will you see the son
of the living one, and you will not be afraid"

(38) Jesus said, "Many times have you desired to hear these words which I am saying to
you, and you have no one else to hear them from. There will be days when you will look
for me and will not find me."

(39) Jesus said, "The pharisees and the scribes have taken the keys of knowledge (gnosis)
and hidden them. They themselves have not entered, nor have they allowed to enter those
who wish to. You, however, be as wise as serpents and as innocent as doves."

(40) Jesus said, "A grapevine has been planted outside of the father, but being unsound, it
will be pulled up by its roots and destroyed."

(41) Jesus said, "Whoever has something in his hand will receive more, and whoever has
nothing will be deprived of even the little he has."

(42) Jesus said, "Become passers-by."
