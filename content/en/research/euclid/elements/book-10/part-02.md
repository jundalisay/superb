For let the rectangle AC be contained by the medial straight-lines AB and BC (which are) commensurable in square only. I say that AC is either rational or medial.
For let the squares AD and BE have been described on (the straight-lines) AB and BC (respectively). AD and BE are thus each medial. And let the rational (straight-line) FG be laid out. And let the rectangular parallelogram GH, equal to AD, have been applied to FG, producing FH as breadth. And let the rectangular parallelogram MK, equal to AC, have been applied to HM, producing HK as breadth. And, finally, let NL, equal to BE, have similarly been applied to KN, pro- ducing KL as breadth. Thus, FH, HK, and KL are in a straight-line. Therefore, since AD and BE are each medial, and AD is equal to GH, and BE to NL, GH and NL (are) thus each also medial. And they are ap- plied to the rational (straight-line) FG. FH and KL are thus each rational, and incommensurable in length with FG [Prop. 10.22]. And since AD is commensurable with BE, GH is thus also commensurable with NL. And as

GH is to NL, so FH (is) to KL [Prop. 6.1]. Thus, FH is commensurable in length with KL [Prop. 10.11]. Thus, FH and KL are rational (straight-lines which are) com- mensurable in length. Thus, the (rectangle contained) by FH and KL is rational [Prop. 10.19]. And since DB is equal to BA, and OB to BC, thus as DB is to BC, so AB (is) to BO. But, as DB (is) to BC, so DA (is) to AC [Props. 6.1]. And as AB (is) to BO, so AC (is) to CO [Prop. 6.1]. Thus, as DA is to AC, so AC (is) to CO. And AD is equal to GH, and AC to MK, and CO to NL. Thus, as GH is to MK, so MK (is) to NL. Thus, also, as FH is to HK, so HK (is) to KL [Props. 6.1, 5.11]. Thus, the (rectangle contained) by FH and KL is equal to the (square) on HK [Prop. 6.17]. And the (rectangle contained) by FH and KL (is) rational. Thus, the (square) on HK is also rational. Thus, HK is ratio- nal. And if it is commensurable in length with FG then HN is rational [Prop. 10.19]. And if it is incommensu- rable in length with FG then KH and HM are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only: thus, HN is medial [Prop. 10.21]. Thus, HN is either ra- tional or medial. And HN (is) equal to AC. Thus, AC is either rational or medial.
Thus, the... by medial straight-lines (which are) com- mensurable in square only, and so on....
Proposition 26
A medial (area) does not exceed a medial (area) by a rational (area).

For, if possible, let the medial (area) AB exceed the medial (area) AC by the rational (area) DB. And let the rational (straight-line) EF be laid down. And let the rectangular parallelogram FH, equal to AB, have been applied to to EF, producing EH as breadth. And let FG, equal to AC, have been cut off (from FH). Thus, the remainder BD is equal to the remainder KH. And DB is rational. Thus, KH is also rational. Therefore, since AB and AC are each medial, and AB is equal to FH, and AC to FG, FH and FG are thus each also medial.


And they are applied to the rational (straight-line) EF. Thus, HE and EG are each rational, and incommensu rable in length with EF [Prop. 10.22]. And since DB is rational, and is equal to KH, KH is thus also ratio- nal. And (KH) is applied to the rational (straight-line) EF. GH is thus rational, and commensurable in length with EF [Prop. 10.20]. But, EG is also rational, and in- commensurable in length with EF. Thus, EG is incom- mensurable in length with GH [Prop. 10.13]. And as EG is to GH, so the (square) on EG (is) to the (rectan- gle contained) by EG and GH [Prop. 10.13 lem.]. Thus, the (square) on EG is incommensurable with the (rect- angle contained) by EG and GH [Prop. 10.11]. But, the (sum of the) squares on EG and GH is commensurable with the (square) on EG. For (EG and GH are) both rational. And twice the (rectangle contained) by EG and GH is commensurable with the (rectangle contained) by EG and GH [Prop. 10.6]. For (the former) is double the latter. Thus, the (sum of the squares) on EG and GH is incommensurable with twice the (rectangle con- tained) by EG and GH [Prop. 10.13]. And thus the sum of the (squares) on EG and GH plus twice the (rectan- gle contained) by EG and GH, that is the (square) on EH [Prop. 2.4], is incommensurable with the (sum of the squares) on EG and GH [Prop. 10.16]. And the (sum of the squares) on EG and GH (is) rational. Thus, the (square) on EH is irrational [Def. 10.4]. Thus, EH is irrational [Def. 10.4]. But, (it is) also rational. The very thing is impossible.
Thus, a medial (area) does not exceed a medial (area) by a rational (area). (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.


## Proposition 27

To find (two) medial (straight-lines), containing a ra- tional (area), (which are) commensurable in square only. A B C D
Let the two rational (straight-lines) A and B, (which are) commensurable in square only, be laid down. And let C-the mean proportional (straight-line) to A and B-

have been taken [Prop. 6.13]. And let it be contrived that as A (is) to B, so C (is) to D [Prop. 6.12].
And since the rational (straight-lines) A and B are commensurable in square only, the (rectangle con- tained) by A and B-that is to say, the (square) on C [Prop. 6.17]-is thus medial [Prop 10.21]. Thus, C is medial [Prop. 10.21]. And since as A is to B, [so] C (is) to D, and A and B [are] commensurable in square only, C and D are thus also commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.11]. And C is medial. Thus, D is also medial [Prop. 10.23]. Thus, C and D are medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only. I say that they also contain a rational (area). For since as A is to B, so C (is) to D, thus, alternately, as A is to C, so B (is) to D [Prop. 5.16]. But, as A (is) to C, (so) C (is) to B. And thus as C (is) to B, so B (is) to D [Prop. 5.11]. Thus, the (rectangle contained) by C and D is equal to the (square) on B [Prop. 6.17]. And the (square) on B (is) rational. Thus, the (rectangle contained) by C and D [is] also rational.
Thus, (two) medial (straight-lines, C and D), con- taining a rational (area), (which are) commensurable in square only, have been found. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

Let the [three] rational (straight-lines) A, B, and C, (which are) commensurable in square only, be laid down. And let, D, the mean proportional (straight-line) to A and B, have been taken [Prop. 6.13]. And let it be con- trived that as B (is) to C, (so) D (is) to E [Prop. 6.12].
Since the rational (straight-lines) A and B are com- mensurable in square only, the (rectangle contained) by A and B-that is to say, the (square) on D [Prop. 6.17]- is medial [Prop. 10.21]. Thus, D (is) medial [Prop. 10.21]. And since B and C are commensurable in square only, and as B is to C, (so) D (is) to E, D and E are thus com- mensurable in square only [Prop. 10.11]. And D (is) me- dial. E (is) thus also medial [Prop. 10.23]. Thus, D and E are medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only. So, I say that they also enclose a medial (area). For since as B is to C, (so) D (is) to E, thus,



altemately, as B (is) to D, (so) C (is) to E [Prop. 5.16]. And as B (is) to D, (so) D (is) to A. And thus as D (is) to A, (so) C (is) to E. Thus, the (rectangle contained) by A and C is equal to the (rectangle contained) by D and E [Prop. 6.16]. And the (rectangle contained) by A and C is medial [Prop. 10.21]. Thus, the (rectangle contained) by D and E (is) also medial.
Thus, (two) medial (straight-lines, D and E), con- taining a medial (area), (which are) commensurable in square only, have been found. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

## Lemma I

To find two square numbers such that the sum of them is ako square.
D
C B
Let the two numbers AB and BC be laid down. And let them be either (both) even or (both) odd. And since, if an even (number) is subtracted from an even (number), or if an odd (number is subtracted) from an odd (num- ber), then the remainder is even [Props. 9.24, 9.26], the remainder AC is thus even. Let AC have been cut in half at D. And let AB and BC also be either similar plane (numbers), or square (numbers)-which are them- selves also similar plane (numbers). Thus, the (num- ber created) from (multiplying) AB and BC, plus the square on CD, is equal to the square on BD [Prop. 2.6]. And the (number created) from (multiplying) AB and BC is square-inasmuch as it was shown that if two similar plane (numbers) make some (number) by mul- tiplying one another then the (number so) created is square [Prop. 9.1]. Thus, two square numbers have been found (namely,) the (number created) from (mul- tiplying) AB and BC, and the (square) on CD-which, (when) added (together), make the square on BD.
And (it is) clear that twosquare (numbers) have again been found (namely,) the (square) on BD, and the (square) on CD-such that their difference (namely,) the (rectangle) contained by AB and BC-is square whenever AB and BC are similar plane (numbers). But, when they are not similar plane numbers, two square (numbers) have been found-(namely,) the (square) on BD, and the (square) on DC-between which the difference (namely,) the (rectangle) contained by AB and BC-is not square. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.



## Lemma II

To find two square numbers such that the sum of them is not square.

D F E


For let the (number created) from (multiplying) AB and BC, as we said, be square. And (let) CA (be) even. And let CA have been cut in half at D. 

So it is clear that the square (number created) from (multiplying) AB and BC, plus the square on CD, is equal to the square on BD [see previous lemma]. Let the unit DE have been subtracted (from BD). Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) AB and BC, plus the (square) on CE, is less than the square on BD. I say, therefore, that the square (number created) from (multiplying) AB and BC, plus the (square) on CE, is not square.

For if it is square, it is either equal to the (square) on BE, or less than the (square) on BE, but cannot any more be greater (than the square on BE), lest the unit be divided. First of all, if possible, let the (number created) from (multiplying) AB and BC, plus the (square) on CE, be equal to the (square) on BE. And let GA be double the unit DE. Therefore, since the whole of AC is double the whole of CD, of which AG is double DE, the remain- der GC is thus double the remainder EC. 

Thus, GC has been cut in half at E. 

Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) GB and BC, plus the (square) on CE, is equal to the square on BE [Prop. 2.6]. 

But, the (number created) from (multiplying) AB and BC, plus the (square) on CE, was also assumed (to be) equal to the square on BE. Thus, the (number created) from (multi- plying) GB and BC, plus the (square) on CE, is equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) AB and BC, plus the (square) on CE.

Subtracting the (square) on CE from both, AB is inferred (to be) equal to GB. The very thing is absurd. Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) AB and BC, plus the (square) on CE, is not equal to the (square) on BE. So I say that (it is) not less than the (square) on BE either.

For, if possible, let it be equal to the (square) on BF. And (let) HA (be) dou- ble DF. And it can again be inferred that HC (is) double CF. Hence, CH has also been cut in half at F. 

On account of this, the (number created) from (multiplying) HB and BC, plus the (square) on FC, becomes equal to the (square) on BF [Prop. 2.6].

The (number created) from (multiplying) AB and BC, plus the (square) on CE, was also assumed (to be) equal to the (square) on BF. 

Hence, the (number created) from (multiplying) HB and BC, plus the (square) on CF, will also be equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) AB and BC, plus the (square) on CE. The very thing is absurd. Thus,
the (number created) from (multiplying) AB and BC,
plus the (square) on CE, is not equal to less than the
(square) on BE. And it was shown that (is it) not equal
to the (square) on BE either. 

Thus, the (number created) from (multiplying) AB and BC, plus the square on CE, is not square. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
