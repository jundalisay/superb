Definitions
1. Those magnitudes measured by the same measure are said (to be) commensurable, but (those) of which no (magnitude) admits to be a common measure (are said to be) incommensurable.
2. (Two) straight-lines are commensurable in square+ when the squares on them are measured by the same area, but (are) incommensurable (in square) when no area admits to be a common measure of the squares on them.§
3. These things being assumed, it is proved that there exist an infinite multitude of straight-lines commensu- rable and incommensurable with an assigned straight- line those (incommensurable) in length only, and those also (commensurable or incommensurable) in square." Therefore, let the assigned straight-line be called ratio- nal. And (let) the (straight-lines) commensurable with it, either in length and square, or in square only, (also be called) rational. But let the (straight-lines) incommensu- rable with it be called irrational.*
4. And let the square on the assigned straight-line be called rational. And (let areas) commensurable with it (also be called) rational. But (let areas) incommensu- rable with it (be called) irrational, and (let) their square- roots (also be called) irrational-the sides themselves, if the (areas) are squares, and the (straight-lines) describ- ing squares equal to them, if the (areas) are some other rectilinear (figure)."

## Proposition 1

If, from the greater of two unequal magnitudes (which are) laid out, (a part) greater than half is sub- tracted, and (if from) the remainder (a part) greater than half (is subtracted), and (if) this happens continually, then some magnitude will (eventually) be left which will be less than the lesser laid out magnitude.
Let AB and C be two unequal magnitudes, of which (let) AB (be) the greater. I say that if (a part) greater than half is subtracted from AB, and (if a part) greater than half (is subtracted) from the remainder, and (if) this happens continually, then some magnitude will (eventu- ally) be left which will be less than the magnitude C.

For C, when multiplied (by some number), will some- times be greater than AB [Def. 5.4]. Let it have been (so) multiplied. And let DE be (both) a multiple of C, and greater than AB. And let DE have been divided into the (divisions) DF, FG, GE, equal to C. And let BH, (which is) greater than half, have been subtracted from AB. And (let) HK, (which is) greater than half, (have been subtracted) from AH. And let this happen continu- ally, until the divisions in AB become equal in number to the divisions in DE.
Therefore, let the divisions (in AB) be AK, KH, HB, being equal in number to DF, FG, GE. And since DE is greater than AB, and EG, (which is) less than half, has been subtracted from DE, and BH, (which is) greater than half, from AB, the remainder GD is thus greater than the remainder HA. And since GD is greater than HA, and the half GF has been subtracted from GD, and HK, (which is) greater than half, from HA, the remain- der DF is thus greater than the remainder AK. And DF (is) equal to C. C is thus also greater than AK. Thus, AK (is) less than C.
Thus, the magnitude AK, which is less than the lesser laid out magnitude C, is left over from the magnitude AB. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show. - (The theorem) can similarly be proved even if the (parts) subtracted are halves.

Proposition 2
If the remainder of two unequal magnitudes (which are) [laid out] never measures the (magnitude) before it, (when) the lesser (magnitude is) continually subtracted in turn from the greater, then the (original) magnitudes will be incommensurable.
For, AB and CD being two unequal magnitudes, and AB (being) the lesser, let the remainder never measure the (magnitude) before it, (when) the lesser (magnitude is) continually subtracted in turn from the greater. I say that the magnitudes AB and CD are incommensurable. A G

For if they are commensurable then some magnitude will measure them (both). If possible, let it (so) measure (them), and let it be E. And let AB leave CF less than itself (in) measuring FD, and let CF leave AG less than itself (in) measuring BG, and let this happen continually, until some magnitude which is less than E is left. Let (this) have occurred, and let AG, (which is) less than E, have been left. Therefore, since E measures AB, but AB measures DF, E will thus also measure FD. And it also measures the whole (of) CD. Thus, it will also mea- sure the remainder CF. But, CF measures BG. Thus, E also measures BG. And it also measures the whole (of) AB. Thus, it will also measure the remainder AG, the greater (measuring) the lesser. The very thing is impos- sible. Thus, some magnitude cannot measure (both) the magnitudes AB and CD. Thus, the magnitudes AB and CD are incommensurable [Def. 10.1).
Thus, if... of two unequal magnitudes, and so on....
Proposition 3

AF H

H
CE
B
Let AB and CD be the two given magnitudes, of which (let) AB (be) the lesser. So, it is required to find the greatest common measure of AB and CD.
For the magnitude AB either measures, or (does) not (measure), CD. Therefore, if it measures (CD), and (since) it also measures itself, AB is thus a common mea- sure of AB and CD. And (it is) clear that (it is) also (the) greatest. For a (magnitude) greater than magnitude AB cannot measure AB.
So let AB not measure CD. And continually subtract- ing in turn the lesser (magnitude) from the greater, the remaining (magnitude) will (at) some time measure the (magnitude) before it, on account of AB and CD not be- ing incommensurable [Prop. 10.2]. And let AB leave EC less than itself (in) measuring ED, and let EC leave AF less than itself (in) measuring FB, and let AF measure CE.

Therefore, since AF measures CE, but CE measures FB, AF will thus also measure FB. And it also mea- sures itself. Thus, AF will also measure the whole (of) AB. But, AB measures DE. Thus, AF will also mea- sure ED. And it also measures CE. Thus, it also mea- sures the whole of CD. Thus, AF is a common measure of AB and CD. So I say that (it is) also (the) greatest (common measure). For, if not, there will be some mag- nitude, greater than AF, which will measure (both) AB and CD. Let it be G. Therefore, since G measures AB, but AB measures ED, G will thus also measure ED. And it also measures the whole of CD. Thus, G will also mea- sure the remainder CE. But CE measures FB. Thus, G will also measure FB. And it also measures the whole (of) AB. And (so) it will measure the remainder AF, the greater (measuring) the lesser. The very thing is im- possible. Thus, some magnitude greater than AF cannot measure (both) AB and CD. Thus, AF is the greatest common measure of AB and CD.
Thus, the greatest common measure of two given commensurable magnitudes, AB and CD, has been found. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
Corollary
So (it is) clear, from this, that if a magnitude measures two magnitudes then it will also measure their greatest
common measure.


## Proposition 4

To find the greatest common measure of three given commensurable magnitudes.

A
B
C
DE F
Let A, B, C be the three given commensurable mag- nitudes. So it is required to find the greatest common measure of A, B, C.
For let the greatest common measure of the two (mag- nitudes) A and B have been taken [Prop. 10.3], and let it be D. So D either measures, or [does] not [measure], C. Let it, first of all, measure (C). Therefore, since D mea- sures C, and it also measures A and B, D thus measures A, B, C. Thus, D is a common measure of A, B, C. And (it is) clear that (it is) also (the) greatest (common mea- sure). For no magnitude larger than D measures (both) A and B.
So let D not measure C. I say, first, that C and D are commensurable. For if A, B, C are commensurable then some magnitude will measure them which will clearly also measure A and B. Hence, it will also measure D, the greatest common measure of A and B [Prop. 10.3 corr.]. And it also measures C. Hence, the aforementioned mag- nitude will measure (both) C and D. Thus, C and D are commensurable [Def. 10.1]. Therefore, let their greatest common measure have been taken [Prop. 10.3], and let it be E. Therefore, since E measures D, but D measures (both) A and B, E will thus also measure A and B. And it also measures C. Thus, E measures A, B, C. Thus, E is a common measure of A, B, C. So I say that (it is) also (the) greatest (common measure). For, if possible, let F be some magnitude greater than E, and let it measure A, B, C. And since F measures A, B, C, it will thus also measure A and B, and will (thus) measure the greatest common measure of A and B [Prop. 10.3 corr.]. And D is the greatest common measure of A and B. Thus, F measures D. And it also measures C. Thus, F measures (both) C and D. Thus, F will also measure the greatest common measure of C and D [Prop. 10.3 corr.]. And it is E. Thus, F will measure E, the greater (measuring) the lesser. The very thing is impossible. Thus, some [magni- tude] greater than the magnitude E cannot measure A, B, C. Thus, if D does not measure C then E is the great- est common measure of A, B, C. And if it does measure (C) then D itself (is the greatest common measure).
Thus, the greatest common measure of three given commensurable magnitudes has been found. [(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.]
Corollary
So (it is) clear, from this, that if a magnitude measures three magnitudes then it will also measure their greatest
common measure.
So, similarly, the greatest common measure of more (magnitudes) can also be taken, and the (above) corol- lary will go forward. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

## Proposition 5

Commensurable magnitudes have to one another the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number.
E
Let A and B be commensurable magnitudes. I say that A has to B the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number.
For if A and B are commensurable (magnitudes) then some magnitude will measure them. Let it (so) measure (them), and let it be C. And as many times as C measures A, so many units let there be in D. And as many times as C measures B, so many units let there be in E.
Therefore, since C measures A according to the units in D, and a unit also measures D according to the units in it, a unit thus measures the number D as many times as the magnitude C (measures) A. Thus, as C is to A, so a unit (is) to D [Def. 7.20]. Thus, inversely, as A (is) to C, so D (is) to a unit [Prop. 5.7 com.]. Again, since C measures B according to the units in E, and a unit also measures E according to the units in it, a unit thus measures E the same number of times that C (measures) B. Thus, as C is to B, so a unit (is) to E [Def. 7.20]. And it was also shown that as A (is) to C, so D (is) to a unit. Thus, via equality, as A is to B, so the number D (is) to the (number) E [Prop. 5.22].
Thus, the commensurable magnitudes A and B have to one another the ratio which the number D (has) to the number E. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
ers, rather than two number and two magnitudes.
Proposition 6
If two magnitudes have to one another the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number then the magni- tudes will be commensurable.
A
Dr
B
Er
F
For let the two magnitudes A and B have to one an- other the ratio which the number D (has) to the number E. I say that the magnitudes A and B are commensu- rable.

For, as many units as there are in D, let A have been divided into so many equal (divisions). And let C be equal to one of them. And as many units as there are in E, let F be the sum of so many magnitudes equal to C.
Therefore, since as many units as there are in D, so many magnitudes equal to C are also in A, therefore whichever part a unit is of D, C is also the same part of A. Thus, as C is to A, so a unit (is) to D [Def. 7.20]. And a unit measures the number D. Thus, C also measures A. And since as C is to A, so a unit (is) to the [number] D, thus, inversely, as A (is) to C, so the number D (is) to a unit [Prop. 5.7 corr.]. Again, since as many units as there are in E, so many (magnitudes) equal to C are also in F, thus as C is to F, so a unit (is) to the [number] E [Def. 7.20]. And it was also shown that as A (is) to C, so D (is) to a unit. Thus, via equality, as A is to F, so D (is) to E [Prop. 5.22]. But, as D (is) to E, so A is to B. And thus as A (is) to B, so (it) also is to F [Prop. 5.11]. Thus, A has the same ratio to each of B and F. Thus, B is equal to F [Prop. 5.9]. And C measures F. Thus, it also measures B. But, in fact, (it) also (measures) A. Thus, C measures (both) A and B. Thus, A is commensurable with B [Def. 10.1].
Thus, if two magnitudes... to one another, and so on
Corollary
So it is clear, from this, that if there are two numbers, like D and E, and astraight-line, like A, then it is possible to contrive that as the number D (is) to the number E, so the straight-line (is) to (another) straight-line (ie., F). And if the mean proportion, (say) B, is taken of A and F, then as A is to F, so the (square) on A (will be) to the (square) on B. That is to say, as the first (is) to the third, so the (figure) on the first (is) to the similar, and similarly described, (figure) on the second [Prop. 6.19 com.]. But, as A (is) to F, so the number D is to the number E. Thus, it has also been contrived that as the number D (is) to the number E, so the (figure) on the straight-line A (is) to the (similar figure) on the straight-line B. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
Proposition 7
Incommensurable magnitudes do not have to one an- other the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number.
Let A and B be incommensurable magnitudes. I say that A does not have to B the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number.





For if A has to B the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number then A will be commensurable with B [Prop. 10.6]. But it is not. Thus, A does not have to B the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number. Thus, incommensurable numbers do not have to one another, and so on....
Proposition 8
If two magnitudes do not have to one another the ra- tio which (some) number (has) to (some) number then the magnitudes will be incommensurable.
A+ B
For let the two magnitudes A and B not have to one another the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number. I say that the magnitudes A and B are incom- mensurable.
For if they are commensurable, A will have to B the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number [Prop. 10.5]. But it does not have (such a ratio). Thus, the magnitudes A and B are incommensurable.
Thus, if two magnitudes... to one another, and so on
Proposition 9
Squares on straight-lines (which are) commensurable in length have to one another the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number. And squares having to one another the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number will also have sides (which are) commensurable in length. But squares on straight-lines (which are) incommensurable in length do not have to one another the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number. And squares not having to one another the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number will not have sides (which are) commensurable in length either.
Ar CH
Br
D
For let A and B be (straight-lines which are) commen- surable in length. I say that the square on A has to the square on B the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.

For since A is commensurable in length with B, A thus has to B the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number [Prop. 10.5]. Let it have (that) which C (has) to D. Therefore, since as A is to B, so C (is) to D. But the (ratio) of the square on A to the square on B is the square of the ratio of A to B. For similar figures are in the squared ratio of (their) corresponding sides [Prop. 6.20 com.]. And the (ratio) of the square on C to the square on D is the square of the ratio of the [number] C to the [number] D. For there exits one number in mean proportion to two square numbers, and (one) square (number) has to the (other) square [num- ber] a squared ratio with respect to (that) the side (of the former has) to the side (of the latter) [Prop. 8.11]. And, thus, as the square on A is to the square on B, so the square [number] on the (number) C (is) to the square [number] on the [number] D.+
And so let the square on A be to the (square) on Bas the square (number) on C (is) to the [square] (number) on D. I say that A is commensurable in length with B.
For since as the square on A is to the [square] on B, so the square (number) on C (is) to the [square] (number) on D. But, the ratio of the square on A to the (square) on B is the square of the (ratio) of A to B [Prop. 6.20 corr.]. And the (ratio) of the square [number] on the [number] C to the square [number] on the [number] D is the square of the ratio of the [number] C to the [number] D [Prop. 8.11]. Thus, as A is to B, so the [number] C also (is) to the [number] D. A, thus, has to B the ratio which the number C has to the number D. Thus, A is commensurable in length with B [Prop. 10.6].
And so let A be incommensurable in length with B. I say that the square on A does not have to the [square] on B the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
For if the square on A has to the [square] on B the ra- tio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number then A will be commensurable (in length) with B. But it is not. Thus, the square on A does not have to the [square] on the B the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
So, again, let the square on A not have to the [square] on B the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number. I say that A is incommensurable in length with B.
For if A is commensurable (in length) with B then the (square) on A will have to the (square) on B the ra- tio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number. But it does not have (such a ratio). Thus, A is not commensurable in length with B.
Thus, (squares) on (straight-lines which are) commensurable in length, and so on....
Corollary
And it will be clear, from (what) has been demon- strated, that (straight-lines) commensurable in length (are) always also (commensurable) in square, but (straight- lines commensurable) in square (are) not always also (commensurable) in length.

A+
E
D
B
C
Let A be the given straight-line. So it is required to find two straight-lines incommensurable with A, the one (incommensurable) in length only, the other also (incom- mensurable) in square.
For let two numbers, B and C, not having to one another the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number-that is to say, not (being) simi- lar plane (numbers)-have been taken. And let it be con- trived that as B (is) to C, so the square on A (is) to the square on D. For we leamed (how to do this) [Prop. 10.6 corr.]. Thus, the (square) on A (is) commensurable with the (square) on D [Prop. 10.6]. And since B does not have to the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number, the (square) on A thus does not have to the (square) on D the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either. Thus, A is incommensurable in length with D [Prop. 10.9]. Let the (straight-line) E (which is) in mean proportion to A and D have been taken [Prop. 6.13]. Thus, as A is to D, so the square on A (is) to the (square) on E [Def. 5.9]. And A is incommensurable in length with D. Thus, the square on A is also incommensurble with the square on E [Prop. 10.11]. Thus, A is incommensurable in square with E.


Thus, two straight-lines, D and E, (which are) in- commensurable with the given straight-line A, have been found, the one, D, (incommensurable) in length only, the other, E, (incommensurable) in square, and, clearly, also in length. [(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.]

Proposition 11
If four magnitudes are proportional, and the first is commensurable with the second, then the third will also be commensurable with the fourth. And if the first is in- commensurable with the second, then the third will also be incommensurable with the fourth.

Let A, B, C, D be four proportional magnitudes, (such that) as A (is) to B, so C (is) to D. And let A be commensurable with B. I say that C will also be com- mensurable with D.
For since A is commensurable with B, A thus has to B the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number [Prop. 10.5]. And as A is to B, so C (is) to D. Thus, C also has to D the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number. Thus, C is commensurable with D [Prop. 10.6].
And so let A be incommensurable with B. I say that C will also be incommensurable with D. For since A is incommensurable with B, A thus does not have to B the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number [Prop. 10.7]. And as A is to B, so C (is) to D. Thus, C does not have to D the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number either. Thus, C is incommensurable with D [Prop. 10.8).
Thus, if four magnitudes, and so on.
Proposition 12
(Magnitudes) commensurable with the same magni- tude are also commensurable with one another.
For let A and B each be commensurable with C. I say that A is also commensurable with B.
For since A is commensurable with C, A thus has to C the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number [Prop. 10.5]. Let it have (the ratio) which D (has) to E. Again, since C is commensurable with B, C thus has to B the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number [Prop. 10.5]. Let it have (the ratio) which F (has) to G. And for any multitude whatsoever


of given ratios F to G-let the numbers H, K, L (which are) contin- uously (proportional) in the (se) given ratios have been taken [Prop. 8.4]. Hence, as D is to E, so H (is) to K, and as F (is) to G, so K (is) to L.

Therefore, since as A is to C, so D (is) to E, but as D (is) to E, so H (is) to K, thus also as A is to C, so H (is) to K [Prop. 5.11]. Again, since as C is to B, so F (is) to G, but as F (is) to G, [so] K (is) to L, thus also as C (is) to B, so K (is) to L [Prop. 5.11]. And also as A is to C, so H (is) to K. Thus, via equality, as A is to B, so H (is) to L [Prop. 5.22]. Thus, A has to B the ratio which the number H (has) to the number L. Thus, A is commensurable with B [Prop. 10.6].
Thus, (magnitudes) commensurable with the same magnitude are also commensurable with one another. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

For if B is commensurable with C, but A is also com- mensurable with B, A is thus also commensurable with C [Prop. 10.12]. But, (it is) also incommensurable (with C). The very thing (is) impossible. Thus, B is not com- mensurable with C. Thus, (it is) incommensurable. Thus, if two magnitudes are commensurable, and so on....
Lemma
For two given unequal straight-lines, to find by (the square on) which (straight-line) the square on the greater

(straight-line is) larger than (the square on) the lesser.
Let AB and C be the two given unequal straight-lines, and let AB be the greater of them. So it is required to find by (the square on) which (straight-line) the square on AB (is) greater than (the square on) C.
Let the semi-circle ADB have been described on AB. And let AD, equal to C, have been inserted into it [Prop. 4.1]. And let DB have been joined. So (it is) clear that the angle ADB is a right-angle [Prop. 3.31], and that the square on AB (is) greater than (the square on) AD-that is to say, (the square on) C-by (the square on) DB [Prop. 1.47).
And, similarly, the square-root of (the sum of the squares on) two given straight-lines is also found likeso.
Let AD and DB be the two given straight-lines. And let it be necessary to find the square-root of (the sum of the squares on) them. For let them have been laid down such as to encompass a right-angle-(namely), that (angle encompassed) by AD and DB. And let AB have been joined. (It is) again clear that AB is the square-root of (the sum of the squares on) AD and DB [Prop. 1.47]. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

Proposition 14
If four straight-lines are proportional, and the square on the first is greater than (the square on) the sec ond by the (square) on (some straight-line) commen- surable [in length] with the first, then the square on the third will also be greater than (the square on) the fourth by the (square) on (some straight-line) commen- surable [in length] with the third. And if the square on the first is greater than (the square on) the second by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable [in length] with the first, then the square on the third will also be greater than (the square on) the fourth by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable [in length] with the third.
Let A, B, C, D be four proportional straight-lines, (such that) as A (is) to B, so C (is) to D. And let the square on A be greater than (the square on) B by the



(square) on E, and let the square on C be greater than (the square on) D by the (square) on F. I say that A is either commensurable (in length) with E, and C is also commensurable with F, or A is incommensurable (in length) with E, and C is also incommensurable with
F.

For since as A is to B, so C (is) to D, thus as the (square) on A is to the (square) on B, so the (square) on C (is) to the (square) on D [Prop. 6.22]. But the (sum of the squares) on E and B is equal to the (square) on A, and the (sum of the squares) on D and F is equal to the (square) on C. Thus, as the (sum of the squares) on E and B is to the (square) on B, so the (sum of the squares) on D and F (is) to the (square) on D. Thus, via separation, as the (square) on E is to the (square) on B, so the (square) on F (is) to the (square) on D [Prop. 5.17]. Thus, also, as E is to B, so F (is) to D [Prop. 6.22]. Thus, inversely, as B is to E, so D (is) to F [Prop. 5.7 corr.]. But, as A is to B, so C also (is) to D. Thus, via equality, as A is to E, so C (is) to F [Prop. 5.22]. Therefore, A is either commensurable (in length) with E, and C is also commensurable with F, or A is incommensurable (in length) with E, and C is also incommensurable with F [Prop. 10.11]. Thus, if, and so on....
Proposition 15
If two commensurable magnitudes are added together then the whole will also be commensurable with each of them. And if the whole is commensurable with one of them then the original magnitudes will also be commen- surable (with one another).
For let the two commensurable magnitudes AB and BC be laid down together. I say that the whole AC is also commensurable with each of AB and BC.

B
D
For since AB and BC are commensurable, some mag- nitude will measure them. Let it (so) measure (them), and let it be D. Therefore, since D measures (both) AB and BC, it will also measure the whole AC. And it also measures AB and BC. Thus, D measures AB, BC, and AC. Thus, AC is commensurable with each of AB and BC [Def. 10.1].
And so let AC be commensurable with AB. I say that AB and BC are also commensurable.
For since AC and AB are commensurable, some mag- nitude will measure them. Let it (so) measure (them), and let it be D. Therefore, since D measures (both) CA and AB, it will thus also measure the remainder BC. And it also measures AB. Thus, D will measure (both) AB and BC. Thus, AB and BC are commensurable [Def. 10.1].
Thus, if two magnitudes, and so on....
Proposition 16

For let the two incommensurable magnitudes AB and BC be laid down together. I say that that the whole AC is also incommensurable with each of AB and BC.
For if CA and AB are not incommensurable then some magnitude will measure [them]. If possible, let it (so) measure (them), and let it be D. Therefore, since D measures (both) CA and AB, it will thus also mea- sure the remainder BC. And it also measures AB. Thus, D measures (both) AB and BC. Thus, AB and BC are commensurable [Def. 10.1]. But they were also assumed (to be) incommensurable. The very thing is impossible. Thus, some magnitude cannot measure (both) CA and AB. Thus, CA and AB are incommensurable [Def. 10.1]. So, similarly, we can show that AC and CB are also incommensurable. Thus, AC is incommensurable with each of AB and BC.
And so let AC be incommensurable with one of AB and BC. So let it, first of all, be incommensurable with 

AB. I say that AB and BC are also incommensurable. For if they are commensurable then some magnitude will measure them. Let it (so) measure (them), and let it be D. Therefore, since D measures (both) AB and BC, it will thus also measure the whole AC. And it also mea- sures AB. Thus, D measures (both) CA and AB. Thus, CA and AB are commensurable [Def. 10.1]. But they were also assumed (to be) incommensurable. The very thing is impossible. Thus, some magnitude cannot mea- sure (both) AB and BC. Thus, AB and BC are incom- mensurable [Def. 10.1].
Thus, if two...magnitudes, and so on....

If a parallelogram, falling short by a square figure, is applied to some straight-line then the applied (parallelo- gram) is equal (in area) to the (rectangle contained) by the pieces of the straight-line created via the application (of the parallelogram).

For let the parallelogram AD, falling short by the square figure DB, have been applied to the straight-line AB. I say that AD is equal to the (rectangle contained) by AC and CB.
And it is immediately obvious. For since DB is a square, DC is equal to CB. And AD is the (rectangle contained) by AC and CD-that is to say, by AC and CB.
Thus, if... to some straight-line, and so on....
Proposition 17+
If there are two unequal straight-lines, and a (rect- angle) equal to the fourth part of the (square) on the lesser, falling short by a square figure, is applied to the greater, and divides it into (parts which are) commen- surable in length, then the square on the greater will be larger than (the square on) the lesser by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable [in length] with the greater. And if the square on the greater is larger than (the square on) the lesser by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable [in length] with the



greater, and a (rectangle) equal to the fourth (part) of the (square) on the lesser, falling short by a square figure, is applied to the greater, then it divides it into (parts which are) commensurable in length.
Let A and BC be two unequal straight-lines, of which (let) BC (be) the greater. And let a (rectangle) equal to the fourth part of the (square) on the lesser, A—that is, (equal) to the (square) on half of A-falling short by a square figure, have been applied to BC. And let it be the (rectangle contained) by BD and DC [see previous lemma]. And let BD be commensurable in length with DC. I say that that the square on BC is greater than the (square on) A by (the square on some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with (BC).

B F

D C
For let BC have been cut in half at the point E [Prop. 1.10]. And let EF be made equal to DE [Prop. 1.3]. Thus, the remainder DC is equal to BF. And since the straight-line BC has been cut into equal (pieces) at E, and into unequal (pieces) at D, the rectangle contained by BD and DC, plus the square on ED, is thus equal to the square on EC [Prop. 2.5]. (The same) also (for) the quadruples. Thus, four times the (rectangle contained) by BD and DC, plus the quadruple of the (square) on DE, is equal to four times the square on EC. But, the square on A is equal to the quadruple of the (rectangle contained) by BD and DC, and the square on DF is equal to the quadruple of the (square) on DE. For DF is double DE. And the square on BC is equal to the quadruple of the (square) on EC. For, again, BC is dou- ble CE. Thus, the (sum of the) squares on A and DF is equal to the square on BC. Hence, the (square) on BC is greater than the (square) on A by the (square) on DF. Thus, BC is greater in square than A by DF. It must also be shown that BC is commensurable (in length) with DF. For since BD is commensurable in length with DC, BC is thus also commensurable in length with CD [Prop. 10.15]. But, CD is commensurable in length with CD plus BF. For CD is equal to BF [Prop. 10.6]. Thus, BC is also commensurable in length with BF plus CD [Prop. 10.12]. Hence, BC is also commensurable in length with the remainder FD [Prop. 10.15]. Thus, the square on BC is greater than (the square on) A by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with (BC).

And so let the square on BC be greater than the (square on) A by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with (BC). And let a (rect- angle) equal to the fourth (part) of the (square) on A, falling short by a square figure, have been applied to BC. And let it be the (rectangle contained) by BD and DC. It must be shown that BD is commensurable in length with DC.
For, similarly, by the same construction, we can show that the square on BC is greater than the (square on) A by the (square) on FD. And the square on BC is greater than the (square on) A by the (square) on (some straight- line) commensurable (in length) with (BC). Thus, BC is commensurable in length with FD. Hence, BC is also commensurable in length with the remaining sum of BF and DC [Prop. 10.15]. But, the sum of BF and DC is commensurable [in length] with DC [Prop. 10.6]. Hence, BC is also commensurable in length with CD [Prop. 10.12]. Thus, via separation, BD is also commen- surable in length with DC [Prop. 10.15].

## Proposition 18

If there are two unequal straight-lines, and a (rect- angle) equal to the fourth part of the (square) on the lesser, falling short by a square figure, is applied to the greater, and divides it into (parts which are) incom- mensurable [in length], then the square on the greater will be larger than the (square on the) lesser by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with the greater. And if the square on the greater is larger than the (square on the) lesser by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in) length) with the greater, and a (rectangle) equal to the fourth (part) of the (square) on the lesser, falling short by a square figure, is applied to the greater, then it divides it into (parts which are) incommensurable [in length].
Let A and BC be two unequal straight-lines, of which (let) BC (be) the greater. And let a (rectangle) equal to the fourth [part] of the (square) on the lesser, A, falling short by a square figure, have been applied to BC. And let it be the (rectangle contained) by BDC. And let BD be incommensurable in length with DC. I say that that the square on BC is greater than the (square on) A by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with (BC).

C
For, similarly, by the same construction as before, we can show that the square on BC is greater than the (square on) A by the (square) on FD. [Therefore] it must be shown that BC is incommensurable in length with DF. For since BD is incommensurable in length with DC, BC is thus also incommensurable in length with CD [Prop. 10.16]. But, DC is commensurable (in length) with the sum of BF and DC [Prop. 10.6]. And, thus, BC is incommensurable (in length) with the sum of BF and DC [Prop. 10.13]. Hence, BC is also incommen- surable in length with the remainder FD [Prop. 10.16]. And the square on BC is greater than the (square on) A by the (square) on FD. Thus, the square on BC is greater than the (square on) A by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with (BC).
So, again, let the square on BC be greater than the (square on) A by the (square) on (some straight-line) in- commensurable (in length) with (BC). And let a (rect- angle) equal to the fourth [part] of the (square) on A, falling short by a square figure, have been applied to BC. And let it be the (rectangle contained) by BD and DC. It must be shown that BD is incommensurable in length with DC.
For, similarly, by the same construction, we can show that the square on BC is greater than the (square) on A by the (square) on FD. But, the square on BC is greater than the (square) on A by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with (BC). Thus, BC is incommensurable in length with FD. Hence, BC is also incommensurable (in length) with the re- maining sum of BF and DC [Prop. 10.16]. But, the sum of BF and DC is commensurable in length with DC [Prop. 10.6]. Thus, BC is also incommensurable in length with DC (Prop. 10.13]. Hence, via separa- tion, BD is also incommensurable in length with DC [Prop. 10.16].
Thus, if there are two... straight-lines, and so on....

Proposition 19

For let the square AD have been described on AB. AD is thus rational [Def. 10.4]. And since AB is com- mensurable in length with BC, and AB is equal to BD, BD is thus commensurable in length with BC. And as BD is to BC, so DA (is) to AC [Prop. 6.1]. Thus, DA is commensurable with AC [Prop. 10.11]. And DA (is) rational. Thus, AC is also rational [Def. 10.4]. Thus, the... by rational straight-lines...commensurable, and

For let the rational (area) AC have been applied to the rational (straight-line) AB, producing the (straight-line) BC as breadth. I say that BC is rational, and commen- surable in length with BA.
For let the square AD have been described on AB.



AD is thus rational [Def. 10.4]. And AC (is) also ratio- nal. DA is thus commensurable with AC. And as DA is to AC, so DB (is) to BC [Prop. 6.1]. Thus, DB is
also commensurable (in length) with BC [Prop. 10.11]. And DB (is) equal to BA. Thus, AB (is) also commen- surable (in length) with BC. And AB is rational. Thus, BC is also rational, and commensurable in length with AB [Def. 10.3].
Thus, if a rational (area) is applied to a rational (straight-line), and so on....

For let the rectangle AC be contained by the rational straight-lines AB and BC (which are) commensurable in square only. I say that AC is irrational, and its square- root is irrational-let it be called medial.
For let the square AD have been described on AB. AD is thus rational [Def. 10.4]. And since AB is incom- mensurable in length with BC. For they were assumed to be commensurable in square only. And AB (is) equal to BD. DB is thus also incommensurable in length with BC. And as DB is to BC, so AD (is) to AC [Prop. 6.1]. Thus, DA [is] incommensurable with AC [Prop. 10.11]. And DA (is) rational. Thus, AC is irrational [Def. 10.4]. Hence, its square-root [that is to say, the square-root of the square equal to it] is also irrational [Def. 10.4]-let it be called medial. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

Lemma
If there are two straight-lines then as the first is to the second, so the (square) on the first (is) to the (rectangle contained) by the two straight-lines.
Let FE and EG be two straight-lines. I say that as FE is to EG, so the (square) on FE (is) to the (rectangle contained) by FE and EG.
For let the square DF have been described on FE. And let GD have been completed. Therefore, since as FE is to EG, so FD (is) to DG [Prop. 6.1], and FD is the (square) on FE, and DG the (rectangle contained) by DE and EG-that is to say, the (rectangle contained) by FE and EG-thus as FE is to EG, so the (square) on FE (is) to the (rectangle contained) by FE and EG. And also, similarly, as the (rectangle contained) by GE and EF is to the (square on) EF-that is to say, as GD (is) to FD-so GE (is) to EF. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
Proposition 22
The square on a medial (straight-line), being ap- plied to a rational (straight-line), produces as breadth a (straight-line which is) rational, and incommensurable in length with the (straight-line) to which it is applied.
A C D E
F
Let A be a medial (straight-line), and CB a rational (straight-line), and let the rectangular area BD, equal to the (square) on A, have been applied to BC, producing CD as breadth. I say that CD is rational, and incommen- surable in length with CB.
For since A is medial, the square on it is equal to a 

(rectangular) area contained by rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.21]. Let the square on (A) be equal to GF. And the square on (A) is also equal to BD. Thus, BD is equal to GF. And (BD) is also equiangular with (GF). And for equal and equiangular parallelograms, the sides about the equal an- gles are reciprocally proportional [Prop. 6.14]. Thus, pro- portionally, as BC is to EG, so EF (is) to CD. And, also, as the (square) on BC is to the (square) on EG, so the (square) on EF (is) to the (square) on CD [Prop. 6.22]. And the (square) on CB is commensurable with the (square) on EG. For they are each rational. Thus, the (square) on EF is also commensurable with the (square) on CD [Prop. 10.11]. And the (square) on EF is ratio- nal. Thus, the (square) on CD is also rational [Def. 10.4]. Thus, CD is rational. And since EF is incommensurable in length with EG. For they are commensurable in square only. And as EF (is) to EG, so the (square) on EF (is) to the (rectangle contained) by FE and EG [see previ- ous lemma]. The (square) on EF [is] thus incommen- surable with the (rectangle contained) by FE and EG [Prop. 10.11]. But, the (square) on CD is commensu- rable with the (square) on EF. For they are rational in square. And the (rectangle contained) by DC and CB is commensurable with the (rectangle contained) by FE and EG. For they are (both) equal to the (square) on A. Thus, the (square) on CD is also incommensurable with the (rectangle contained) by DC and CB [Prop. 10.13]. And as the (square) on CD (is) to the (rectangle con- tained) by DC and CB, so DC is to CB [see previous lemma]. Thus, DC is incommensurable in length with CB [Prop. 10.11]. Thus, CD is rational, and incommen- surable in length with CB. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

## Proposition 23

A (straight-line) commensurable with a medial (straight- line) is medial.
Let A be a medial (straight-line), and let B be com- mensurable with A. I say that B is also a medial (staight- line).
Let the rational (straight-line) CD be set out, and let the rectangular area CE, equal to the (square) on A, have been applied to CD, producing ED as width. ED is thus rational, and incommensurable in length with CD [Prop. 10.22]. And let the rectangular area CF, equal to the (square) on B, have been applied to CD, produc- ing DF as width. Therefore, since A is commensurable with B, the (square) on A is also commensurable with



the (square) on B. But, EC is equal to the (square) on A, and CF is equal to the (square) on B. Thus, EC is com- mensurable with CF. And as EC is to CF, so ED (is) to DF [Prop. 6.1]. Thus, ED is commensurable in length with DF [Prop. 10.11]. And ED is rational, and incom- mensurable in length with CD. DF is thus also ratio- nal [Def. 10.3], and incommensurable in length with DC [Prop. 10.13]. Thus, CD and DF are rational, and com- mensurable in square only. And the square-root of a (rect- angle contained) by rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only is medial [Prop. 10.21]. Thus, the square-root of the (rectangle contained) by CD and DF is medial. And the square on B is equal to the (rectangle contained) by CD and DF. Thus, B is a me- dial (straight-line).

## Proposition 24

A rectangle contained by medial straight-lines (which are) commensurable in length is medial.
For let the rectangle AC be contained by the medial straight-lines AB and BC (which are) commensurable in length. I say that AC is medial.

For let the square AD have been described on AB. AD is thus medial [see previous footnote]. And since AB is commensurable in length with BC, and AB (is) equal to BD, DB is thus also commensurable in length with BC. Hence, DA is also commensurable with AC [Props. 6.1, 10.11]. And DA (is) medial. Thus, AC (is) also medial [Prop. 10.23 corr.]. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
