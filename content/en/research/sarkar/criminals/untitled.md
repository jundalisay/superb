Quite alarming that there are so many stagnant sinful people who masquerade as "spiritual" people. 

Two of them do not utilize land for food production (tamad kasi -- stagnant in body). Another bashes college education. All of them share a common theme of bashing intellect while wanting people to stay bobo (stagnant in intellect).

They are unaware that overaccumulation of land and stagnancy of intellect are 2 of the 3 causes of sin in society. This is proven by the paragraph:

"Humanity wants to move ahead, but the stagnant people who are neither human beings nor animals have blocked the way of the Sadvipras and have obstructed their movement.

Where the intellectual standard of the people is low, people commit blunders – prompted by such leaders, they become beasts. 
I call such leaders “political satans” or “political pigs”. Such pigs become leaders only when the intellectual standard of the common people is low.

The common mass will not tolerate these obstructions. Sadvipras will remove this unnaturalness with the blows of their hammers. 

The duty of the Sadvipras will be to hammer these stagnant people, who suffer from inertness in their physico-intellectual sphere, at the appropriate moment so that the path of human progress becomes straight, clear and well-constructed. (Three Causes of Sin, PR Sarkar, 30 May 1970, Muzaffarpur)"


I noticed that if you hammer them, they kick you out. So the only real solution is to wait for them to die of old age.
