## Magellan

Of all her foreign possessions, the Philippines has cost Spain the least blood and labor. 

The honor of their discovery belongs to Magellan whose name is associated with the straits at the southern extremity of the American continent, but which has no memorial in these islands. Now that the glory which he gained by being the first to penetrate from the Atlantic to the Pacific, has been in some measure obliterated by the disuse of those straits by navigators, it would seem due to his memory that some spot among these islands should be set apart to commemorate the name of, him who made them known to Europe. This would be but common justice to the discoverer of a region which has been a source of so much honor and profit to the Spanish nation, who opened the vast expanse of the Pacific to the fleets of Europe, and who died fighting to secure the benefits of his enterprise to his king and country.

Magellan was killed at the island of Mactan, on April 26, 1521. Duarte, the second in command, succeeded him. He imprudently accepted an invitation from the chief of Cebu to a feast, was, with twenty companions, massacred. 

Of all the Spaniards present, only 1 escaped. 

After these and various other misfortunes, only one vessel of the squadron, the Victoria, returned to Spain. Don Juan Sebastian del Cano, her commander, was complimented by his sovereign by a grant for his arms of a globe, with the proud inscription, commemorative of his being the first circumnavigator, “Primus Me Circumcedit.”


## Expedition 2 

Two years later, a second expedition was fitted out, under the command of Loaisa, who died after they had passed through the Straits of Magellan 1 year on their voyage. 

The command then fell upon Sebastian, who died after 4 days. 

Salazar succeeded and reached Guam. <!-- the Ladrone Islands, --> But shortly after leaving there, he died also. 

They came in sight of Mindanao, but contrary winds obliged them to go to the Moluccas. 

Upon arriving at the Portuguese settlements, contentions and jealousies arose. Finally, the whole expedition was dispersed. The fate of all but one of the vessels has become doubtful. 

None but the small tender returned reached New Spain after encountering great difficulties.


## Expedition 3

The third expedition was fitted out by Cortes, then viceroy of Mexico. The command of it given to Saavedra. 

This sailed from the port of Silguattanjo, on October 31, 1528. It stopped at Guam which it claimed for Spain.

It then went to Mindanao, and then went to Timor, where it found part of the expedition of Loaisa. 

From Timor, they made 2 attempts to return to New Spain, both of which failed. 

The climate soon brought on disease, which killed many, including Saavedra. 

Thus, the whole expedition was broken up. The survivors found their way to the Portuguese settlements.


## Expedition 4

The fourth expedition was sent from New Spain, when under the government of Don Antonio de Mendoza, for the purpose of establishing a trade with the new islands. It received orders not to visit the Moluccas. 

This expedition sailed in 1542, under the command of Villalobos. 

It reached the Philippine Islands without accident. Villalobos gave them that name after Philip 2nd, then prince of Asturias.

<!-- Notwithstanding his positive instructions to the contrary, --> 

Despite orders not to visit the Moluccas, he went anyway and met the same treatment from the Portuguese that had been given to all who interfered in their spice trade. 

The squadron touched at Amboina, where Villalobos died. This caused the breaking up of the expedition. The few Spaniards that remained embarked in the Portuguese vessels to return home.


## Expedition 5

The last expedition was ordered by Philip 2nd to be sent from Mexico, when under the government of Don Luis de Velasco, for the final conquest and settlement of the Philippines. 

This expedition included Andres Urdaneta, a friar. He was very highly respected as a cosmographer. He had been with the ill-fated expedition of Loaisa. 

This was the largest that had yet been fitted out. It had 5 vessels and about 400 men. 

Its commander was Legaspi. It sailed from the port of Natividad, on November 21, 1564. 

He was named the governor and adelantado of the conquered lands, with the fullest powers. 

On February 13, 1565, he arrived at the island of Tandaya in the Philippines. From there, he went to Leyte. There, he obtained the son of a powerful chief as a guide, through whom he established peace with several of the native rulers, who thereafter aided the expedition with all the means in their power. 

At Bohol, they built the first church. 

There he met and made peace with a chief of Luzon, with whom he went to that island. (Facts here are confused.—C.)

He now (April, 1565) claimed all the islands for the crown of Spain, and became their first governor. 

In this conquest, motives different from those which governed them on the American continent, seemed to have influenced the Spaniards. 

Instead of carrying on a cruel war against the natives, they here pursued the policy of encouraging and fostering their industry. 

Whether they felt that this policy was necessary for the success of their undertaking, or were influenced by the religious fathers who were with them, is uncertain; but their measures seem to have been dictated by a desire to promote peace and secure the welfare of the inhabitants. There may be another cause for this course of action, namely, the absence of the precious metals, which held out no inducement to those thirsting for inordinate gain. 

This may have had its weight in exempting the expedition in its outset from the presence of those avaricious spirits which had accompanied other Spanish expeditions, and been the means of marking their progress with excessive tyranny, bloodshed, and violence. 

To one who visits the Philippines that some other power besides the sword has been at work in them. 

The natives are amalgamated with the Spaniards, and all seem disposed to cultivate the land and foster civilization. 

None of the feeling that grows out of conquest is to be observed in these islands; the two races are identified now in habits, manners, and religion, and their interests are so closely allied that they feel their mutual dependence upon each other.

The establishment of the new constitution in Spain in the year 1825 has had a wonderful effect upon these colonies, whose resources have within the last 10 years been developed, and improvements pushed forward with a rapid step. Greater knowledge and more liberal views in the rulers are alone wanting to cause a still more rapid advance in the career of prosperity.
