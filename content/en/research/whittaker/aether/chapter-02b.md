Newton died in 1727. 

Of the expositions of his philosophy which were published in his lifetime by his followers, one at least deserves to be noticed for the sake of the insight which it affords into the state of opinion regarding light, heat, and electricity in the first half of the eighteenth century. 

This was the Physices elementa mathematica experimentis confirmata of Wilhelm Jacob s'Gravesande (b. 1688, d. 1742), published at Leyden in 1720. The Latin edition was afterwards reprinted several times, and was, moreover, translated into French and English: it seems to have exercised a considerable and, on the whole, well-deserved influence on contemporary thought.

s'Gravesande supposed light to consist in the projection of corpuscles from luminous bodies to the eye; the motion being very swift, as is shown by astronomical observations. Since many bodies, e.g. tho metals, become luminous when they are heated, he inferred that every substance possesses a natural store of corpuscles, which are expelled when it is heated to incandescence; conversely, corpuscles may become united to a material body; as happens, for instance, when the body is exposed to the rays of a fire. Moreover, since the heat thus acquired is readily conducted throughout the substance of the body, he concluded that corpuscles can penetrate all substances, however hard and dense they be.

Let us here recall the ideas then current regarding the nature of material bodies. 

From the time of Boyle (1626-1691) it had been recognized generally that substances perceptible to the senses may be either elements or compounds or mixtures; the compounds being chemical individuals, distinct from mere mixtures of elements. 

But the substances at that time accepted as elements were very different from those which are now known by the name. Air and the calees[5] of the metals figured in the list, while almost all the chemical elements now recognized were omitted from it; some of them, such as oxygen and hydrogen, because they were as yet undiscovered, and others, such as the metals, because they were believed to be compounds.

Among the chemical elements, it became customary after the time of Newton to include light-corpuscles.[6] That something which is confessedly imponderable should ever have been admitted into this class may at first sight seem surprising. But it must be remembered that questions of ponderability counted for very little with the philosophers of the period. 

3/4 of the 18th century had passed before Lavoisier enunciated the fundamental doctrine that the total weight of the substances concerned in a chemical reaction is the same after the reaction as before it.

As soon as this principle came to be universally applied, light parted company from the true elements in the scheme of chemistry.

We must now consider the views which were held at this time regarding the nature of heat. These are of interest for our present purpose, on account of the analogies which were set up between heat and electricity.

The various conceptions which have been entertained concerning heat fall into one or other of two classes, according as heat is represented as a mere condition producible in bodies, or as a distinct species of matter. The former view, which is that universally hell at the present day, was advocated by the great philosophers of the seventeenth century. 

Bacon maintained it in the Novum Oryanum: "Calor," he wrote, “est motus expansiviis, cohibitus, et nitens per partes minores."[7] Boyle[8] affirmed that the “Nature of Heat” consists in "a various, vehement, and intestine commotion of the Parts among themselves." Hooke[9] declared that "Heat is a property of a body arising from the motion or agitation of its parts." And Newton[10] asked: “Do not all fixed Bodies, when heated beyond a certain Degree, emit light and shine; and is not this Emission performed by the vibrating Motion of their Parts?" and, moreover, suggested the converse of this, namely, that when light is absorbed by a material body, vibrations are set up which are perceived by the senses as heat.

The doctrine that heat is a material substance was maintained in Newton's lifetime by a certain school of chemists. The most conspicuous member of the school was Wilhelm Homberg (b. 1652, d. 1715) of Paris, who[11] identified heat and light with the sulphureous principle, which he supposed to be one of the primary ingredients of all bodies, and to be present even in the inter- planetary spaces. Between this view and that of Newton it might at first seem as if nothing but sharp opposition was to be expected.[12] But a few years later the professed exponents of the Principia and the Opticks began to develop their system under the evident influence of Homberg's writings. This evolution may easily be traced in s'Gravesande, whose starting-point is the admittedly Newtonian idea that heat bears to light a relation similar to that which a state of turmoil bears to regular rectilinear motion; whence, conceiving light as a projection of corpuscles, he infers that in a hot body the material particles and the light-corpuscles[13] are in a state of agitation, which becomes more violent as the body is more intensely heated.

s'Gravesande thus holds a position between the two opposite camps. On the one hand he interprets heat as a mode of motion; but on the other he associates it with the presence of a particular kind of matter, which he further identifies with the matter of light. After this the materialistic hypothesis made rapid progress. It was frankly advocated by another member of the Dutch school, Hermann Boerhaave[14] (b. 1668, d. 1738), Professor in the University of Leyden, whose treatise on chemistry was translated into English in 1727.

Somewhat later it was found that the heating effects of the rays from incandescent bodies may be separated from their luminous effects by passing the rays through a plate of glass, which transmits the light, but absorbs the heat. After this discovery it was no longer possible to identify the matter of heat with the corpuscles of light; and the former was consequently accepted as a distinct element, under the name of calorie.[15] In the latter part of the eighteenth and early part of the nineteenth centuries[16] caloric was generally conceived as occupying the interstices between the particles of ponderable matter—an idea which fitted in well with the observation that bodies commonly expand when they are absorbing heat, but which was less competent to explain the fact[17] that water expands when freezing. The latter difficulty was overcome by supposing the union between a body and the calorie absorbed in the process of melting to be of a chemical nature; so that the consequent changes in volume would be beyond the possibility of prediction.

As we have already remarked, the imponderability of heat did not appear to the philosophers of the eighteenth century to be a sufficient reason for excluding it from the list of chemical elements; and in any case there was considerable doubt as to whether caloric was ponderable or not. Some experimenters believed that bodies were heavier when cold than when hot; others that they were heavier when lot than when cold. The century was far advanced before Lavoisier and Rumford finally proved that the temperature of a body is without sensible influence on its weight.

Perhaps nothing in the history of natural philosophy is more amazing than the vicissitudes of the theory of heat. The true hypothesis, after having met with general acceptance throughout a century, and having been approved by a succession of illustrious men, was deliberately abandoned by their successors in favour of a conception utterly false, and, in some of its developments, grotesque and absurd.


s'Gravesande's explained the phenomena of combustion by assuming that when a body is sufficiently heated the light-corpuscles interact with the material particles, some constituents being in consequence separated and carried away with the corpuscles as flame and smoke. 

This view harmonizes with the theory of calcination which had been developed by Becher and his pupil Stahl at the end of the seventeenth century, according to which the metals were supposed to be composed of their calces and an element phlogiston. 

The process of combustion, by which a metal is changed into its calx, was interpreted as a decomposition, in which the phlogiston separated from the metal and escaped into the atmosphere; while the conversion of the calx into the metal was regarded as a union with phlogiston.[18]

s'Gravesande attributed electric effects to vibrations induced in effluvia, which he supposed to be permanently attached to such bodies as amber. "Glass," he asserted,"contains in it, and has about its surface, a certain atmosphere, which is excited by Friction and put into a vibratory motion; for it attracts and repels light Bodies. 

The smallest parts of the glass are agitated by the Attrition, and by reason of their elasticity, their motion is vibratory, which is communicated to the Atmosphere above-mentioned: and therefore that Atmosphere exerts its action the further, the greater agitation the Parts of the Glass receive when a greater attrition is given to the glass."

The English translator of s'Gravesando's work was himself destined to play a considerable part in the history of electrical science. 

Jean Théophile Desaguliers (b. 1683, d. 1744) was an Englishman only by adoption. His father had been a Huguenot pastor, who, escaping from France after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, brought away the boy from La Rochelle, concealed, it is said, in a tub. 

The young Desaguliers was afterwards ordained, and became chaplain to that Duke of Chandos who was so ungratefully ridiculed by Lope. In this situation he formed friendships with some of the natural philosophers of the capital, and amongst others with Stephen Gray, an experimenter of whom little is known[19] beyond the fact that he was a pensioner of the Charterhouse.

In 1729 Gray communicated, as he says,[20] "to Dr. Desaguliers and some other Gentlemen” a discovery he had lately made, "showing that the Electrick Vertue of a Glass Tube may be conveyed to any other Bodies so as to give them the same Property of attracting and repelling light Bodies as the Tube does, when excited by rubbing: and that this attractive Vertue might be carried to Bodies that were many Feet distant from the Tube."

This was a result of the greatest importance, for previous workers had known of no other way of producing the attractive emanations than by rubbing the body concerned.[21] It was found that only a limited class of substances, among which the metals were conspicuous, had the capacity of acting as channels for the transport of the electric power; to these Desaguliers, who continued the experiments after Gray's death in 1736, gave[22] the name non-electrics or conductors.

After Gray's discovery it was no longer possible to believe that the electric effluvia are inseparably connected with the bodies from which they are evoked by rubbing; and it became necessary to admit that these emanations have an independent existence, and can be transferred from one body to another. Accordingly we find them recognized, under the name of the electric fluid,[23] as one of the substances of which the world is constituted. The imponderability of this fluid did not, for the reasons already mentioned, prevent its admission by the side of light and caloric into the list of chemical elements.

The question was actively debated as to whether the electric fluid was an element sui generis, or, as some suspected, was another manifestation of that principle whose operation is seen in the phenomena of heat.

Those who held the latter view urged that the electric fluid and heat can both be induced by friction, can both induce combustion, and can both be transferred from one body to another by mere contact; and, moreover, that the best conductors of heat are also in general the best conductors of electricity. On the other hand it was contended that, the electrification of a body does not cause any appreciable rise in its temperature; and an experiment of Stephen Gray's brought to light a yet more striking difference. Gray,[24] in 1729, made two oaken cubes, one solid and the other hollow, and showed that when electrified in the same way they produced exactly similar effects; whence he concluded that it was only the surfaces which had taken part in the phenomena. 

Thus while heat is disseminated throughout the substance of a body, the electric fluid resides at or near its surface. In the middle of the eighteenth century it was generally compared to an enveloping atmosphere. “The electricity which a non-electric of great length (for example, a hempen string 800 or 900 feet long) "receives, runs from one end to the other in a sphere of electrical Effluvia," says Desaguliers in 1740[25] and a report of the French Academy in 1733 says:[26] "Around an electrified body there is formed a vortex of exceedingly fine matter in a state of agitation, which urges towards the body such light substances as lie within its sphere of activity. The existence of this vortex is more than a mere conjecture; for when an electrified body is brought close to the face it causes a sensation like that of encountering a cobweb."[27]

The report from which this is quoted was prepared in connexion with the discoveries of Charles-François du Fay (b. 1698, d. 1739), superintendent of gardens to the King of France. Du Fay[28] accounted for the behaviour of gold leaf when brought near to an electrified glass tube by supposing that at first the vortex of the tube envelopes the gold-leaf, and so attracts it towards the tube. But when contact occurs, the gold-leaf acquires the electric virtue, and so becomes surrounded by a vortex of its own. The two vortices, striving to extend in contrary senses, repel each other, and the vortex of the tube, being the stronger, drives away that of the gold-leaf. 

“It is then certain," says du Fay,[29] "that bodies which have become electric by contact are repelled by those which have rendered them electric; but are they repelled likewise by other electrified bodies of all kinds? And do electrified bodies differ from each other in no respect save their intensity of electrification? An examination of this matter has led me to a discovery which I should never have foreseen, and of which I believe no one hitherto has had the least idea."

He found, in fact, that when gold-leaf which had been electrified by contact with excited glass was brought near to an excited piece of copal,[30] an attraction was manifested between them. "I had expected," he writes, "quite the opposite effect, since, according to my reasoning, the copal and gold-leaf, which both electrified, should have repelled each other." Proceeding with his experiments he found that the gold-leaf, when electrified and repelled by glass, was attracted by all electrified resinous substances, and that when repelled by the latter it was attracted by the glass. “We see, then," he continues, "that there are two electricities of a totally different nature — namely, that of transparent solids, such as glass, crystal, &e., and that of bituminous or resinous bodies, such as amber, copal, sealing-wax, &e. Each of them repels bodies which have contracted an electricity of the same nature as its own, and attracts those whose electricity is of the contrary nature. We see even that bodies which are not themselves electrics can acquire either of these electricities, and that then their effects are similar to those of the bodies which have communicated it to them."

To the two kinds of electricity whose existence was thus demonstrated, du Fay gave the names vitreous and resinous, by which they have ever since been known.
