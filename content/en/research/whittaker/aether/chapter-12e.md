Can humans know absolute position in space relative to the aether?

Newton's laws of motion does not supply any criterion to distinguish rest from uniform motion

If the laws of motion are applicable when the position of bodies is referred to any particular set of axes, they will be equally applicable when position is referred to any other set of axes which have a uniform motion of translation relative to these.

The older theories of electrostatics, magnetism, and electrodynamics were based on the concept of action at a distance. They are concerned only with relative configurations and motions, and are therefore useless in the search for a basis of absolute reckoning.

But the existence of an aether, seems at first sight to involve the conceptions of rest and motion relative to it. It thus affords a way to specify absolute position. 

If a disturbance is generated at any point in free aether, this disturbance will spread outwards in the form of a sphere..

The centre of this sphere will for all subsequent time occupy an unchanged position relative to the aether. 

In this way, or in many other ways, we might hope to determine, by electrical or optical experiments, the velocity of the earth relative to the aether.

The failure of such experiments led FitzGerald[84] to suggest that the dimensions of material bodies undergo contraction when the bodies are in motion relative to the aether. 

By the transformation of Lorentz and Larmor, this hypothesis got a new form; namely that the equation of the figure of the body, referred to a frame of reference moving with it, is always the same, but that frames of reference which are in notion relative to each other are based on different standards of length and time. 

This way of regarding the matter brings into prominence the fundamental questions involved. 

Before speaking of lengths and velocities, it is necessary to examine the nature of systems of measurement of space and time.

Of the events with which Natural Philosophy is concerned, each is perceived to happen at some definite location at some definite moment. When a material object has been observed to occupy a certain position at a certain instant, the same object may again be observed at a subsequent instant; 

but it is impossible to determine whether the object is or is not in the same position, since there is no obvious means of preserving the identity of any location from one moment to another. The physicist, however, finds it convenient to construct a framework of axes in space and time for the purpose of fitting his experiences into an orderly arrangement; and the question at issue is whether experience furnishes the means of determining a framework completely and uniquely by absolute properties, or whether the selection inevitably rests on arbitrary choice and accidental circumstance.

In attempting to answer this question, it may first be observed that the choice is always made so as to simplify the description of natural phenomena as much as possible; thus, the variable which is to measure time is so chosen that its increment in the interval between any two consecutive beats of a pendulum is the same as its increment in the interval between any other two consecutive beats. If the selection of the four variables (x, y, z, t) is well made, it should be possible to express the laws of nature by statements of a simple character, e.g., that a body isolated from the influence of external agents moves through equal intervals of space in equal intervals of time.

Accepting, then, the principle that the framework of axes is to be chosen so as to furnish the simplest possible expression of the natural laws, it becomes of importance to determine which of the natural laws are entitled, by reason of their primary importance, to receive the greatest consideration.

Now many indications point to the probability that the various types of forces which are observed in ponderable bodies—forces of cohesion, of chemical union, and so forth—are ultimately electric in their nature. Such an assumption would have the great advantage of explaining the contraction postulated by Fitz Gerald, since it would represent the contraction as actually produced by the notion. 

But if this assumption be correct, the theory of electricity and aether is without doubt the fundamental theory of Natural Philosophy, and the framework of space and time should be chosen with a view chiefly to the expression of electrical phenomena. This may most naturally be done by stipulating that the wave-fronts of disturbances generated in free aether shall, in the system of length and time adopted, be accounted spheres whose centres are at the origins of disturbance and whose radii are proportional to the times elapsed since their initiation. Referred to axes of (x, y, z, t) which satisfy these conditions, the fundamental equations of the electric field assume the form which has been taken as the basis of all our theoretical investigations.

Imagine now a distant star which is moving with a uniform velocity w or o tanh a relative to this framework (x, y, z, t). 

The theorem of transformation shows that there exists another framework (x1, y1, z1, t1), with respect to which the star is at rest, and in which moreover the condition laid down regarding the wave-surface is satisfied. This framework is peculiarly fitted for the representation of the phenomena which happen on the star; whose inhabitants would therefore naturally adopt it as their system of space and time. 

Beings, on the other hand, who dwell on a body which is at rest with respect to the axes (x, y, z, t) would prefer to use the latter system, and from the point of view of the universe at large, either of these systems is as good as the other. The equations of motion of the aether are the same with respect to both sets of coordinates, and therefore neither can claim to possess the only property which could confer a primacy—namely, an absolute relation to the aether.[85]

To sum up, we may say that the phenomena whose study is the object of Natural Philosophy take place each at a definite ​location at a definite moment; the whole constituting a four-dimensional world of space and time. To construct a set of axes of space and time is equivalent to projecting this four-dimensional world into a three-dimensional world of space and a one-dimensional world of time, and this projection may be performed in an infinite number of ways, each of which is distinguished from the others only by characteristics merely arbitrary and accidental.[86]

In order to represent natural phenomena without introducing this contingent element, it would be necessary to abandon the customary three-dimensional system of coordinates, and to operate in four dimensions. Analysis of this kind has been devised, and has been applied to the theory of the aether; but its development belongs to the twentieth century, and consequently falls outside the scope of the present work.

From what has been said, it will be evident that, in the closing years of the nineteenth century, electrical investigation was chiefly concerned with systems in motion. The theory of electrons was, however, applied with success in other directions, and notably to the explanation of a new experimental discovery.

The last recorded observation of Faraday[87] was an attempt to detect changes in the period, or in the state of polarization, of the light emitted by a sodium flame, when the flame was placed in a strong magnetic field. No result was obtained; but the conviction that an effect of this nature remained to be discovered was felt by many of his successors. Tait[88] examined the influence of a magnetic field on the selective absorption of light; impelled thereto, as he explained, by theoretical considerations. For from the phenomenon of magnetic rotation it may be inferred[89] that rays circularly polarized in opposite senses are propagated with different velocities in the magnetized medium; and therefore if only those rays are absorbed which have a ​certain definite wave-length in the medium, the period of the ray absorbed from a beam of circularly polarized white light will not be the same when the polarization is right-handed as when it is left-handed. "Thus," wrote Tait, "what was originally a single dark absorption-line might become a double line."

The effect anticipated under different forms by Faraday and Tait was discovered, towards the end of 1896, by I. Zeeman.[90] Repeating Faraday's procedure, he placed a sodium fame between the poles of an electromagnet, and observed a widening of the D-lines in the spectrum when the magnetizing current was applied.

A theoretical explanation of the phenomenon was immediately furnished to Zeeman by Lorentz.[91] The radiation is supposed to be emitted by electrons which describe orbits. within the sodium atoms. If e denote the charge of an electron of mass m, the ponderomotive force which acts on it by virtue of the external magnetic field is e ['i.K], where K denotes the magnetic force and r denotes the displacement of the electron from its position of equilibrium; and therefore, if the force which restrains the electron in its orbit be κ2r, the equation of motion of the electron is


The motion of the electron may (as is shown in treatises on dynamics) be represented by the superposition of certain particular solutions called principal oscillations, whose distinguishing property is that they are periodic in the time. In order to determine the principal oscillations, we write 


for r, where r0, denotes a vector which is independent of the time, and n denotes the frequency of the principal oscillation: substituting in the equation, we have


This equation may be satisfied either (1) if r0, is parallel to K, in which case it reduces to


so that n has the value κm-

, or (2) if r0 is at right angles to K, in which case by squaring both sides of the equation we obtain the result

which gives for n the approximate values κm-


When there is no external magnetic field, so that K is zero, the three values of n which have been obtained all reduce to κm-

, which represents the frequency of vibration of the emitted light before the magnetic field is applied. When the field is applied, this single frequency is replaced by the three frequencies. κm-

 - eK/2m; that is to say, the single line in the spectrum is replaced by three lines close together. The apparatus used by Zeeman in his earliest experiments was not of sufficient power to exhibit this triplication distinctly, and the effect was therefore described at first as a widening of the spectral lines.[92]

We have seen above that the principal oscillation of the electron corresponding to the frequency κm-

 is performed in a direction parallel to the magnetic force K. It will therefore give rise to radiation resembling that of a Hertzian vibrator, and the electric vector of the radiation will be parallel to the lines of force of the external magnetic field. It follows that when the light received in the spectroscope is that which has been emitted in a direction at right angles to the magnetic field, this constituent (which is represented by the middle line of the triplet in the spectrum) will appear polarized in a plane at right angles to the field; but when the light received in the spectroscope is that which has been emitted in the direction of the magnetic force, this constituent will be absent.

We have also seen that the principal oscillations of the electron corresponding to the frequencies κm-
1
2
 ± eK/2m are ​performed in a plane at right angles to the magnetic field K. In order to determine the nature of these two principal oscillations, we observe that it is possible for the electron to describe a circular orbit in this plane, if the radius of the orbit be suitably chosen; for in a circular motion the forces κ2r and 


would be directed towards the centre of the circle; and it would therefore be necessary only to adjust the radius so that these furnish the exact amount of centripetal force required. Such a motion, being periodic, would be a principal oscillation. Moreover, since the force 


changes sign when the sense of the movement in the circle is reversed, it is evident that there are two such circular orbits, corresponding to the two senses in which the electron may circulate; these must, therefore, be no other than the two principal oscillations of frequencies κm-

When the light received in the spectroscope is that which has been emitted in a direction at right angles to the external magnetic field, the circles are seen edgewise, and the light appears polarized in a plane parallel to the field; but when the light examined is that which has been emitted in a direction parallel to the external magnetic force, the radiations of frequencies κm-


are seen to be circularly polarized in opposite senses. All these theoretical .conclusions have been verified by observation.

It was found by Cornu[93] and by C. G. W. König[94] that the more refrangible component (i.e., the one whose period is shorter than that of the original radiation) has its circular vibration in the same sense as the current in the electromagnet. From this. it may be inferred that the vibration must be due to a resinously charged electron; for let the magnetizing current and the electron be supposed to circulate round the axis of z in the direction in which a right-handed screw must turn in order to progress along the positive direction of the axis of z; then the magnetic force is directed positively along the axis of z, and, in order that the force on the electron may be directed ​inward to the axis of z (so as to shorten the period), the charge on the electron must be negative.

The value of e/m for this negative electron may be determined by measurement of the separation between the components of the triplet in a magnetic field of known strength; for, as we have seen, the difference of the frequencies of the outer components is eK/m. The values of e/m thus determined agree well with the estimations[95] of e/m for the corpuscles of cathode rays.

The phenomenon discovered by Zeeman is closely related to the magnetic rotation of the plane of polarization of light.[96] Both effects may be explained by supposing that the molecules of material bodies contain electric systems which possess natural periods of vibration, the simplest example of such a system being an electron which is attracted to a fixed centre with a force proportional to the distance.

Zeeman's effect represents the influence of al external magnetic field on the free oscillations of these electric systems, while Faraday's effect represents the influence of the external magnetic field on the forced oscillations which the systems perform under the stimulus of incident light. The latter phenomenon may be analysed without difficulty on these principles, the equation of motion of one of the electrons being taken in the form


where m denotes the mass and e the charge of the electron, r its distance from the centre of force, κ2r the restitutive force, E and H the electric and magnetic forces. When the electron performs forced oscillations under the influence of light of frequency n, this equation becomes


The influence of the magnetic force on the motion of the electron is small compared with the influence of the electric force, i.e. the second term on the right is small compared with the first term; so in the second term we may replace r by its ​value as found from the first term, namely, eE/(κ2 – mn2). The equation thus becomes

If P denote[97] the electric moment per unit volume, we have

P = er × the number of such systems in unit volume of the medium;

so P must be of the form

where ε evidently represents the dielectric constant of the medium, and σ is the coefficient which measures the magnetic rotatory power. In the magneto-optic term we may replace H by K, the external magnetic force, since this is large compared with the magnetic force of the luminous vibrations. Thus if D denote the electric induction, we have

Combining this with the usual electromagnetic equations,

we have

When a plane wave of light is propagated through the medium in the direction of the lines of magnetic force, and the axis of x is taken parallel to this direction, the equation gives

and these equations, as we have seen,[98] are competent to explain the rotation of the plane of polarization.

From the occurrence of the factor (κ2 – mn2) in the denomi. nator of the expression for the magneto-optic constant σ, it may be inferred that the magnetic rotation will be very large for light whose period is nearly the same as a free period of vibration of the electrons. A large rotation is in fact observed[99] when plane-polarized light, whose frequency differs but little from the frequencies of the D-lines, is passed through sodium vapour in a direction parallel to the lines of magnetic force.

The optical properties of metals may be explained, according to the theory of electrons, by a slight extension of the analysis which applies to the propagation of light in transparent substances, It is, in fact, only necessary to suppose that some of the electrons in metals are free instead of being bound to the molecules: a supposition which may be embodied in the equations by assuming that an electric force E gives rise to a polarization P, where

the term in α represents the effect of the inertia of the electrons; the term in β represents their ohmic drift; and the term in γ represents the effect of the restitutive forces where these exist. This equation is to be combined with the customary electromagnetic equations

In discussing the propagation of light through the metal, we may for convenience suppose that the beam is plane-polarized ​and propagated parallel to the axis of z, the electric vector being parallel to the axis of x. Thus the equations of motion reduce to

For Ex, and Px we may substitute exponential functions of


where n denotes the frequency of the light, and μ the quasi-index of refraction of the metal: the equations then give at once

Writing 

for `μ`, so that ν is inversely proportional to the velocity of light in the medium, and κ denotes the coefficient of absorption, and equating separately the real and imaginary parts of the equation, we obtain

When the wave-length of the light is very large, the inertia represented by the constant α has but little influence, and the equations reduce to those of Maxwell's original theory[100] of the propagation of light in metals. The formulae were experimentally confirmed for this case by the researches of E. Hagen and H, Rubens[101] with infra-red light; a relation being thus established between the ohmic conductivity of a metal and its optical properties with respect to light of great wavelength.

When, however, the luminous vibrations are performed more rapidly, the effect of the inertia becomes predominant; and ​if the constants of the metal are such that, for a certain range of values of n, ν2κ is small, while ν2(1 - κ2) is negative, it is evident that, for this range of values of n, ν will be small and κ large, i.e., the properties of the metal will approach those of ideal silver.[102] Finally, for indefinitely great values of n, ν2κ is small and ν2(1 - κ2) is nearly unity, so that ν tends to unity and κ to zero: an approximation to these conditions is realized in the X-rays.[103]

In the last years of the nineteenth century, attempts were made to form more definite conceptions regarding the behaviour of electrons within metals. It will be remembered that the original theory of electrons had been proposed by Weber[104] for the purpose of explaining the phenomena of electric currents in metallic wires. Weber, however, made but little progress towards an electric theory of metals; for being concerned chiefly with magneto-electric induction and electromagnetic ponderomotive force, be scarcely brought the metal into the discussion at all, except in the assumption that electrons of opposite signs travel with equal and opposite velocities relative to its substance. The more comprehensive scheme of his successors half a century afterwards aimed at connecting in a unified theory all the known electrical properties of metals, such as the conduction of currents according to Ohm's law, the thermo-electric effects of Seebeck, Peltier, and W. Thomson, the galvano-magnetic effect of Hall, and other phenomena which will be mentioned subsequently.

The later investigators, indeed, ranged beyond the group of purely electrical properties, and sought by aid of the theory of electrons to explain the conduction of heat. The principal ground on which this extension was justified was an experimental result obtained in 1853 by G. Wiedemann and R. Franz,[105] who found ​that at any temperature the ratio of the thermal conductivity of a body to its ohmic conductivity is approximately the same for all metals, and that the value of this ratio is proportional to the absolute temperature. In fact, the conductivity of a pure metal for heat is almost independent of the temperature; while the electric conductivity varies in inverse proportion to the absolute temperature, so that a pure metal as it approaches the absolute zero of temperature tends to assume the character of a perfect conductor. That the two conductivities are closely related was shown to be highly probable by the experiments of Tait, in which pieces of the same metal were found to exhibit variations in ohmic conductivity exactly parallel to variations in their thermal conductivity.

The attempt to explain the electrical and thermal properties of metals by aid of the theory of electrons rests on the assumption that conduction in metals is more or less similar to conduction in electrolytes; at any rate, that positive and negative charges drift in opposite directions through the substance of the conductor under the influence of an electric field. It was remarked in 1888 by J. J. Thomson,[106] who must be regarded as the founder of the modern theory, that the differences which are perceived between metallic and electrolytic conduction may be referred to special features in the two cases, which do not affect their general resemblance. electrolytes the carriers are provided only by the salt, which is dispersed throughout a large inert mass of solvent; whereas in metals it may be supposed that every molecule is capable of furnishing carriers. Thomson, therefore, proposed to regard the current in metals as a series of intermittent discharges, caused by the rearrangement of the constituents of molecular systems—a conception similar to that by which Grothuss[107] had pictured conduction in electrolytes. This view would, as he showed, lead to a general explanation of the connexion between thermal and electrical conductivities,

Most of the later writers on metallic conduction have preferred to take the hypothesis of Arrhenius[108] rather than that of Grothuss as a pattern; and have therefore supposed the interstices between the molecules of the metal to be at all times swarming with electric charges in rapid motion. 11: 1898 E. Riecke[109] effected an important advance by examining the consequences of the assumption that the average velocity of this random motion of the charges is nearly proportional to the square root of the absolute temperature T. P. Drude[110] in 1900 replaced this by the more definite assumption that the kinetic energy of each moving charge is equal to the average kinetic energy of a molecule of a perfect gas at the same temperature, and may therefore be expressed in the form qT, where q denotes a universal constant.

In the same year J. J. Thomson[111] remarked that it would accord with the conclusions drawn from the study of ionization in gases to suppose that the vitreous and resinous charges play different parts in the process of conduction: the resinous charges may be conceived of as carried by simple negative corpuscles or electrons, such as constitute the cathode rays: they may be supposed to move about freely in the interstices between the atoms of the metal. The vitreous charges, on the other hand, may be regarded as more or less fixed in attachment to the metallic atoms. According to this view the transport of electricity is due almost entirely to the motion of the negative charges.

An experiment which was performed at this time by Riecke[112] lent some support to Thomson's hypothesis. A cylinder of aluminium was inserted between two cylinders of copper in a circuit, and a current was passed for such a time that the amount of copper deposited in an electrolytic arrangement ​would have amounted to over a kilogramme. The weight of each of the three cylinders, however, showed no measurable change; from which it appeared unlikely that metallic conduction is accompanied by the transport of metallic ions.
