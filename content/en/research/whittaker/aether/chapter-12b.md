Lorentz was impressed by the success of Fresnel's beautiful theory of the propagation of light in moving transparent substances[36] He:
- designed his equations so as to accord with that theory
- showed that this might be done by:
  - drawing a distinction between matter and aether
  - assuming that a moving ponderable body cannot communicate its motion to the aether which surrounds it, or even to the aether which is entangled in its own particles

In this way, part of the aether can be in motion relative to any other part. 

Such an aether is simply space endowed with certain dynamical properties.

The general plan of Lorentz' investigation was to reduce all the complicated cases of electromagnetic action to one simple and fundamental case, in which the field contains only free aether with solitary electrons dispersed in it.

The theory which he adopted in this fundamental case was a combination of Clausius' theory of electricity with Maxwell's theory of the aether.

Suppose that e(x, y, z) and e′(x′, y′, z′) are two electrons. In the theory of Clausius,[37] the kinetic potential of their mutual action is


so when any number of electrons are present, the part of the kinetic potential which concerns any one of them—say, e—may be written


where a and φ denote potential functions, defined by the

ρ denoting the volume-density of electric charge, and v its velocity, and the integration being taken over all space.

We shall now reject Clausius' assumption that electrons act instantaneously at a distance, and replace it by the assumption that they act on each other only through the mediation of an aether which fills all space, and satisfies Maxwell's equations, This modification may be effected in Clausius' theory without difficulty; for, as we have seen,[38] if the state of Maxwell's aether at any point is defined by the electric vector d and magnetic vector h,[39] these vectors may be expressed in terms of potentials a and φ by the equations

and the functions a and φ may in turn be expressed in terms of the electric charges by the equations

where the bars indicate that the values of (ρvx)′ and (ρ)′ refer to the instant (t - r/c). Comparing these formulae with those given above for Clausius' potentials, we see that the only change which it is necessary to make in Clausius' theory is that of retarding the potentials in the way indicated by L. Lorenz.[40] The electric and magnetic forces, thus defined in terms of the position and motion of the charges, satisfy the Maxwellian equations


The theory of Lorentz is based on these 4 aethereal equations of Maxwell, together with the equation which determines the ponderomotive force on a charged particle. This, which we shall now derive, is the contribution furnished by Clausius' theory. 

The Lagrangian equations of motion of the electron `e` are


and two similar equations, where L denotes the total kinetic potential due to all causes, electric and mechanical. The ponderomotive force exerted on the electron by the electromagnetic field has for its x-component

which, since


reduces to


so that the force in question is


This was Lorentz' expression for the ponderomotive force on an electrified corpuscle of charge e moving with velocity v in a field defined by the electric force d and magnetic force h.

In Lorentz' fundamental case, which has thus been examined, account has been taken only of the ultimate constituents of which the universe is supposed to be composed, namely, corpuscles and the aether. We must now see how to build up from these the more complex systems which are directly presented to our experience.

The electromagnetic field in ponderable bodies, which to our senses appears in general to vary continuously, would present a different aspect if we were able to discern molecular structure; we should then perceive the individual electrons by which the field is produced, and the rapid fluctuations of electric and magnetie* force between them. As it is, the values furnished by our instruments represent averages taken over volumes which, though they appear small to us, are large compared with molecular dimensions.[41] 

We shall denote an average value of this kind by a bar placed over the corresponding symbol.

Lorentz supposed that the phenomena of electrostatic charge and of conduction-currents are due to the presence or motion of simple electrons such as have been considered above. The part of 

arising from these is the measurable density of electrostatic charge; this we shall denote by ρ1. If w denote the velocity of the ponderable matter, and if the velocity v of the electrons be written w + u, then the quantity 

, so far as it arises from electrons of this type, may be written 

 The former of these terms represents the convection-current, and the latter the conduction-current.

Consider next the phenomena of dielectrics. Following Faraday, Thomson, and Mossotti,[42] Lorentz supposed that each dielectric molecule contains corpuscles charged vitreously and also corpuscles charged resinously. These in the absence of an external field are so arranged as to neutralize each other's electric fields outside the molecule. 

For simplicity, we may suppose that in each molecule only one corpuscle, of charge e, is capable of being displaced from its position; it follows from what has been assumed that the other corpuscles in the molecule exert the same electrostatic action as a charge – e situated at the original position of this corpuscle.

Thus if `e` is displaced to an adjacent position, the entire molecule becomes equivalent to an electric doublet, whose moment is measured by the product of e and the displacement of e. The molecules in unit volume, taken together, will in this way give rise to a (vector) electric moment per unit volume, P, which may be compared to the (vector) intensity of magnetization in Poisson's theory of magnetism.[43] As in that theory, we may replace the doublet-distribution P of the scalar quantity ρ by a volume-distribution of ρ, determined by the equation[44

This represents the part of 

 due to the dielectric molecules.

Moreover, the scalar quantity ρwx, has also a doublet-distribution, to which the same theorem may be applied; the average value of the part of ρwx, due to dielectric molecules, is therefore determined by the equation


We have now to find that part of  which is due to dielectric molecules. For a single doublet of moment p we have, by differentiation,


where the integration is taken throughout the molecule; so that

where the integration is taken throughout a volume V, which ​encloses a large number of molecules, but which is small compared with measurable quantities; and this equation may be written



Now, if Ṗ refers to differentiation at a fixed point of space (as opposed to a differentiation which accompanies the moving body), we have

so that


and therefore



This equation determines the part of 

The general equations of the aether thus become, when the averaging process is performed,

convection-current
+
conduction-current


In order to assimilate those to the ordinary electromagnetic equations, we must evidently write

,
the electric force;

,
the electric induction;

,
the electric vector.


The equations then become (writing ρ for ρ1, as there is no longer any need to use the subscript),

where

S = conduction-current + convection-current + Ḋ + curl [P.w].
​The term Ḋ in S evidently represents the displacementcurrent of Maxwell; and the term curl [P.w] will be recognized as a modified form of the term curl [D.w], which was first introduced into the equations by Hertz.[45] 

It will be remembered that Hertz supposed this term to represent the generation of a magnetic force within a dielectric which is in motion in an electric field, and that Heaviside[46] by adducing considerations relative to the energy, showed that the term ought to be regarded as part of the total current, and inferred from its existence that a dielectric which moves in an electric field is the seat of an electric current, which produces a magnetic field in the surrounding space. 

The modification introduced by Lorentz consisted in replacing D by P in the vector-product; this implied that the moving dielectric does not carry along the aethereal displacement, which is represented by the term E/4πc2 in D, but only carries along the charges which exist at opposite ends of the molecules of the ponderable dielectric, and which are represented by the term P. The part of the total current represented by the term curl [P.w] is generally called the current of dielectric convection.

That a magnetic field is produced when an uncharged dielectric is in motion at right angles to the lines of force of a constant electrostatic field had been shown experimentally in 1888 by Röntgen.[47] His experiment consisted in rotating a dielectric disk between the plates of a condenser; a magnetic field was produced, equivalent to that which would be produced by the rotation of the "fictitious charges" on the two faces of the dielectric, i.e., charges which bear the same relation to the dielectric polarization that Poisson's equivalent surfacedensity of magnetism[48] bears to magnetic polarization. If U denote the difference of potential between the opposite coatings of the condenser, and ε the specific inductive capacity of the dielectric, the surface-density of electric charge on the coatings ​is proportional to ±εU, and the fictitious charge on the surfaces of the dielectric is proportional to 


If a plane condenser is charged to a given difference of potential, and is rotated in its own plane, the magnetic field produced is proportional to ε if (as in Rowland's experiment[49]) the coatings are rotated while the dielectric remains at rest, but is in the opposite direction, and is proportional to (ε - 1) if (as in Röntgen's experiment) the dielectric is rotated while the coatings remain at rest. If the coatings and dielectric are rotated together, the magnetic action (being the sum of these) should be independent of ε—a conclusion which was verified later by Eichenwald.[50]

Hitherto we have taken no account of the possible magnetization of the ponderable body. This would modify the equations in the usual manner,[51] so that they finally take the form

where S denotes the total current formed of the displacementcurrent, the convection-current, the conduction-current, and the current of dielectric convection. Moreover, since

we have

which vanishes by virtue of the principle of conservation of electricity. Thus

or the total current is a circuital vector, Equations (I) to (V) are the fundamental equations of Lorentz' theory of electrons.

We have now to consider the relation by which the polarization P of dielectrics is determined. If the dielectric is moving with velocity w, the ponderomotive force on unit electric charge moving with it is (as in all theories)[52]


In order to connect P with E′, it is necessary to consider the motion of the corpuscles. Let e denote tho charge and m the mass of a corpuscle, (ξ, η, ζ, ) its displacement from its position of equilibrium, k2(ξ, η, ζ, ) the restitutive force which retains it in the vicinity of this point; then the equations of motion of the corpuscle are

and similar equations in η and ζ. When the corpuscle is set in motion by light of frequency n passing through the medium, the displacements and forces will be periodic functions of nt—say,

Substituting these values in the equations of motion, we obtain


and therefore

Thus, if N denote the number of polarizable molecules per unit volume, the polarization is determined by the equation


In the particular case in which the dielectric is at rest, this equation gives
But, as we have seen[53] D bears to E the ratio μ2/4πc2, where μ ​denotes the refractive index of the dielectric; and therefore the refractive index is determined in terms of the frequency by the equation

This formula is equivalent to that which Maxwell and Sellmeier[54] had derived from the elastic-solid theory. Though superficially different, the derivations are alike in their essential feature, which is the assumption that the molecules of the dielectric contain systems which possess free periods of vibration, and which respond to the oscillations of the incident light. The formula may be derived on electromagnetic principles without any explicit reference to electrons; all that is necessary is to assume that the dielectric polarization has a free period of vibration.[55]

When the luminous vibrations are very slow, so that n is small, μ2 reduces to the dielectric constant ε[56]; so that the theory of Lorentz leads to the expression

for the specific inductive capacity in terms of the number and circumstances of the electrons.[57]
Returning now to the case in which the dielectric is supposed to be in motion, the equation for the polarization may be written


from this equation, Fresnel's formula for the velocity of light in a moving dielectric may be deduced. For, let the axis of z be taken parallel to the direction of motion of the dielectric, which is supposed to be also the direction of propagation of the light; and, considering a plane-polarized wave, take the axis of x parallel to the electric vector, so that the magnetic vector must be parallel to the axis of y. Then equation (III) above becomes
equation (IV) becomes (assuming B equal to II, as is always the case in optics),
The equation which defines the electric induction gives

and equations (1) and (2) give

Eliminating D., Px, and Ily, we have
or, neglecting w/cº,

Substituting 

{\displaystyle E_{x}=e^{n(t-z/V){\sqrt {-1}}}}, so that V denotes the velocity of light in the moving dielectric with respect to the fixed aether we have


​or (neglecting w2/c2)


which is the formula of Fresnel.[59] 

The hypothesis of Fresnel, that a ponderable body in motion carries with it the excess of aether which it contains as compared with space free from matter, is thus seen to be transformed in Lorentz' theory into the supposition that the polarized molecules of the dielectric, like so many small condensers, increase the dielectric constant, and that it is (so to speak) this augmentation of the dielectric constant which travels with the moving matter. 

One evident objection to Fresnel's theory, namely, that it required the relative velocity of aether and matter to be different for light of different colours, is thus removed; for the theory of Lorentz only requires that the dielectric constant should have different values for light of different colours, and of this a satisfactory explanation is provided by the theory of dispersion.

The correctness of Lorentz' hypothesis, as opposed to that of Hertz (in which the whole of the contained aether was supposed to be transported with the moving body), was afterwards confirmed by various experiments. 

In 1901 R. Blondlot[60] drove a current of air through a magnetic field, at right angles to the lines of magnetic force. 

The air-current was made to pass between the faces of a condenser, which were connected by a wire, so as to be at the same potential. An electromotive force E′ would be produced in the air by its motion in the magnetic field; and, according to the theory of Hertz, this should produce an electric induction D of amount (ε/4πc2)E′ (where ε denotes the specific inductive capacity of the air, which is practically unity); so that, according to Hertz, the faces of the condenser should become charged. According to Lorentz theory, on the other hand, the electric induction D is determined by the equation


where E denotes the electric force on a charge at rest, which is zero in the present case. Thus, according to Lorentz' theory, the charges on the faces would have only (ε - 1)/ε of the values which they would have in Hertz' theory; that is, they would be practically zero. The result of Blondlot's experiment was in favour of the theory of Lorentz.

An experiment of a similar character was performed in 1905 by H. A. Wilson.[61] In this, the space between the inner and outer coatings of a cylindrical condenser was filled with the dielectric ebonite. 

When the coatings of such a condenser are maintained at a definite difference of potential, charges are induced on thein; and if the condenser be rotated on its axis in a magnetic field whose lines of force are parallel to the axis, these charges will be altered, owing to the additional polarization which is produced in the dielectric molecules by their motion in the magnetic field. 

As before, the value of the additional charge according to the theory of Lorentz is (ε - 1)/ε times its value as calculated by the theory of Hertz. The result of Wilson's experiments was, like that of Blondlot's, in favour of Lorentz.

The reconciliation of the electromagnetic theory with Fresnel's law of the propagation of light in moving bodies was a distinct advance.
