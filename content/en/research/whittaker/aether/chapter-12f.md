Lorentz combined the ideas of Thomson, Riecke, and Drude[113] into the most complete form.

It is supposed that the atoms of the metal are fixed, and that in the interstices between them a large number of resinous electrons are in rapid motion. 

The mutual collisions of the electrons are disregarded, so that their collisions with the fixed atoms alone come under consideration; these are regarded as analogous to collisions between moving and fixed elastic spheres.

The flow of heat and electricity in the metal is supposed to take place in a direction parallel to the axis of x, so that the metal is in the same condition at all points of any plane perpendicular to this direction; and the flow is supposed to be steady, so that the state of the system is independent of the time.

Consider a slab of thickness dx and of unit area; and suppose that the number of electrons in this slab whose x-components of velocity lie between u and u + du, whose y-components of velocity lie between v and v + du, and whose z-components of velocity lie between w and w + du, is

f(u, v, w, x) dx du dv dw.

One of these electrons, supposing it to escape collision, will in the interval of time dt travel from (x, y, z) to (x + u dt, y + vdt, z + wdt): and its x-component of velocity will at the end of the interval be increased by an amount eEdt/m, if m and e denote its mass and charge, and E denotes the electric force. Suppose that the number of electrons lost to this group by collisions in the interval dt is a dx du dv dw dt, and that the ​number added to the group by collisions in the same interval is b dx du dv dw dt. Then we have

f (u, v, w, x) + (b - a)dt = f(u + eEdt/m, v, w, x + udt),

and therefore

The law of distribution of velocities which Maxwell postulated for the molecules of a perfect gas at rest is expressed by the equation


where N denotes the number of moving corpuscles in unit volume, r denotes the resultant velocity of a corpuscle (so that r2 = u2 + v2 + w2), and a denotes a constant which specifies the average intensity of agitation, and consequently the temperature. It is assumed that the law of distribution of velocities among the electrons in a metal is nearly of this form; but a term must be added in order to represent the general drifting of the electrons parallel to the axis of x. The simplest assumption that can be made regarding this term is that it is of the form

u × a function of r only;
we shall, therefore, write

The value of χ(r) may now be determined from the equation


for on the left-hand side, the Maxwellian term

would give a zero result, since b is equal to a in Maxwell's system; thus b-a must depend solely on the term uχ(r); and ​an examination of the circumstances of a collision, in the manner of the kinetic theory of gases, shows that (b − a) must have the form -urχ(r)/l, where l denotes a constant which is closely related to the mean free path of the electrons. In the terms on the right-hand side of the equation, on the other hand, Maxwell's term gives a result different from zero; and in comparison with this we may neglect the terms which arisefrom -uχ(r). Thus we have

and thus the law of distribution of velocities is determined.

The electric current i is determined by the equation

where the integration is extended over all possible values of the components of velocity of the electrons. The Maxwellian term in f(u, v, w) furnishes no contribution to this integral, so we have

When the integration is performed, this formula becomes

or

The coefficient of i in this equation must evidently represent the ohmic specific resistance of the metal; so if γ denote the specific conductivity, we have

Let the equation be next applied to the case of two metals. A and B in contact at the same temperature T, forming an ​open circuit in which there is no conduction of heat or electricity (so that i and da/dx are zero). Integrating the equation

across the junction of the metals, we have

Discontinuity of potential at junction 
or since 

ma2, which represents the average kinetic energy of an electron, is by Drude's assumption equal to qT, where q denotes a universal constant, we have

Discontinuity of potential at junction 

This may be interpreted as the difference of potential connected with the Peltier[114] effect at the junction of two metals; the product of the difference of potential and the current measures the evolution of heat at the junction. The Peltier discontinuity of potential is of the order of a thousandth of a volt, and must be distinguished from Volta's contact-difference of potential, which is generally much larger, and which, as it presumably depends on the relation of the metals to the medium in which they are immersed, is beyond the scope of the present investigation.

Returning to the general equations, we observe that the flux of energy W is parallel to the axis of x, and is given by the equation


where the integration is again extended over all possible values of the components of velocity; performing the integration, we have


or, substituting for E from the equation already found,

Consider now the case in which there is conduction of heat without conduction of electricity. The flux of energy will in this case be given by the equation

where κ a denotes the thermal conductivity of the metal expressed in suitable units; or

If it be assumed that the conduction of heat in metals is effected by motion of the electrons, this expression may be compared with the preceding; thus we have

and comparing this with the formula already found for the electric conductivity, we have

an equation which shows that the ratio of the thermal to the electric conductivity is of the form T × a constant which is the same for all metals. This result, accords with the law of Wiedemann and Franz,

Moreover, the value of q is known from the kinetic theory of gases; and the value of e has been determined by J.J. Thomson[115] and his followers; substituting these values in the formula for κ/γ, a fair agreement is obtained with the values of κ/γ determined experimentally.

It was remarked by J. J. Thomson that if, as is postulated in the above theory, a metal contains a great number of free electrons in temperature equilibrium with the atoms, the specific heat of the metal must depend largely on the energy required in order to raise the temperature of the electrons. Thomson considered that the observed specific heats of metals are smaller than is compatible with the theory, and was thus led to investigate[116] the consequences of his original hypothesis[117] regarding the motion of the electrons, which differs from the one just described in much the same way as Grothuss' theory of electrolysis differs from Arrhenius'. 

Each electron was now supposed to be free only for a very short time, from the moment when it is liberated by the dissociation of an atom to the moment when it collides with, and is absorbed by, a different atom. The atoms were conceived to be paired in doublets, one pole of each doublet being negatively, and the other positively, electrified. Under the influence of an external electric field the doublets orient themselves parallel to the electric force, and the electrons which are ejected from their negative poles give rise to a current predominantly in this direction. The electric conductivity of the metal may thus be calculated. In order to comprise the conduction of heat in his theory, Thomson assumed that the kinetic energy with which an electron leaves an atom is proportional to the absolute temperature; so that if one part of the metal is hotter than another, the temperature will be equalized by the interchange of corpuscles. This theory, like the other, leads to a rational explanation of the law of Wiedemann and Franz.

The theory of electrons in metals has received support from the study of another phenomenon. It was known to the philosophers of the eighteenth century that the air near an incandescent metal acquires the power of conducting electricity. "Let the end of a poker," wrote Canton,[118] "when red-hot, be brought but for a moment within three or four inches of a small electrified body, and its electrical power will be almost, if not entirely, destroyed."

The subject continued to attract attention at intervals[119]; ​and as the process of conduction in gases came to be better understood, the conductivity produced in the neighbourhood of incandescent metals was attributed to the emission of electrically charged particles by the metals. But it was not until the develop- mout of J.J. Thomson's theory of ionization in gages that notable advances were made. In 1899, Thomson[120] determined the ratio of the charge to the mass of the resinously charged ions emitted by a hot filament of carbon in rarefied hydrogen, by observing their deflexion in a magnetic field. The value obtained for the ratio was nearly the same as that which he had found for the corpuscles of cathode rays; whence he concluded that the negative ions emitted by the hot carbon were negative electrons.

The corresponding investigation[121] for the positive leak from hot bodies yielded the information that the mass of the positive ions is of the same order of magnitude as the mass of material atoms. There are reasons for believing that these ions are produced from gas which has been absorbed by the superficial layer of the metal.[122]

If, when a hot metal is emitting ions in a rarefied gas, an electromotive force be established between the metal and a neighbouring electrode, either the positive or the negative ions are urged towards the electrode by the electric field, and a current is thus transmitted through the intervening space. 

When the metal is at a higher potential than the electrode, the current is carried by the vitreously charged ions: when the electrode is at the higher potential, by those with resinous charges. In either case, it is found that when the electromotive force is increased indefinitely, the current does not increase indefinitely likewise, but acquires a certain "saturation" value. The obvious explanation of this is that the supply of ions available for carrying the current is limited.

When the temperature of the metal is high, the ions emitted are mainly negative; and it is found[123] that in these circumstances, when the surrounding gas is rarefied, the saturation-current is almost independent of the nature of the gas or of its pressure. The leak of resinous electricity from a metallic surface in a rarefied gas must therefore depend only on the temperature and on the nature of the metal; and it was shown by 0. W. Richardson[124] that the dependence on the temperature may be expressed by an equation of the form

where i denotes the saturation-current per unit area of surface (which is proportional to the number of ions emitted in unit time), T denotes the absolute temperature, and A and b are constants.[125]

In order to account for these phenomena, Richardson[126]adopted the hypothesis which had previously been proposed[127] for the explanation of metallic conductivity; namely, that a metal is to be regarded as a sponge-like structure of comparatively large fixed positive ions and molecules, in the interstices of which negative electrons are in rapid motion. 

Since the electrons do not all escape freely at the surface, he postulated a superficial discontinuity of potential, sufficient to restrain most of them. Thus, let N denote the number of free electrons in unit volume of the metal; then in a parallelepiped whose height measured at right angles to the surface is dx, and whose base is of unit area, the number of electrons whose ​x-components of velocity are comprised between u and u + du is

m denoting the mass of an electron, T the absolute temperature, and q, the universal constant previously introduced.

Now, an electron whose x-component of velocity is u will arrive at the interface within an interval dt of time, provided that at the beginning of this interval it is within a distance udt of the interface. So the number of electrons whose x-components of velocity are comprised between u and u + du which arrive at unit area of the interface in the interval dt is


If the work which an electron must perform in order to escape through the surface layer be denoted by φ, the number of electrons emitted by unit area of metal in unit time is therefore

The current issuing from unit area of the hot metal is thus

where ε denotes the charge on an electron. This expression, being of the form

agrees with the experimental measures; and the comparison furnishes the value of the superficial discontinuity of potential which is implied in the existence of φ.[128]

A few years after the date of this investigation, a plan was ​devised and successfully carried out[129] for determining experimentally the kinetic energy possessed by the ions after emission. The mean kinetic energy of both negative and positive ions was found to be the same for various metals (platinum, gold, silver, etc.), and to be directly proportional to the absolute temperature, and the distribution of velocities among the ions proved to be that expressed by Maxwell's law. The ions may therefore be regarded as kinetically equivalent to the molecules of & gas whose temperature is the same as that of the metal.

By the investigations which have been recorded, the hypothesis of atomic electric charges has been, to all appearances, decisively established. But all the parts of the theory of electrons do not enjoy an equal degree of security; and in particular, it is possible that the future may bring important changes in the conception of the aether. The hope was formerly entertained of discovering an aether by reference to which motion might be estimated absolutely; but such a hope has been destroyed by the researches which have sprung from FitzGerald's hypothesis of contraction, and in some recent writings it is possible to recognize a tendency to replace the classical aether by other conceptions, which, however, have been as yet but indistinctly outlined.

In any event, the close of the nineteenth century brought to an end a well-marked era in the history of natural philosophy

This is true not only with respect to the discoveries themselves, but also in regard to the conditions of scientific organization and endeavour, which in the last decades of that period became profoundly changed. 

The investigators who advanced the theories of aether and electricity, from the time of Descartes to that of Lord Kelvin, were, with very few exceptions, congregated within a narrow territory: from Dublin to the western provinces of Russia, and from Stockholm to the north of Italy, may be circumscribed by a circle of no more than 600 miles radius. 

But throughout the whole of Kelvin's long life, the domain of culture was rapidly extending: the learning of the Germanic and Latin peoples was carried to the furthest regions of the earth: new universities were founded, and inquiries into the secrets of nature were instituted in every quarter of the globe. Let this record close with the anticipation that fellowship in the pursuit of knowledge will increase in the nations the spirit of generous emulation and mutual respect.
