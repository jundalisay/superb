Maxwell and Hertz tried to extend the theory of the electromagnetic field to the case in which ponderable bodies are in motion. But they were not successful. 

Neither writer had taken account of any motion of the material particles relative to the aether entangled with them, so that in both investigations the moving bodies were regarded simply as homogeneous portions of the medium which fills all space, distinguished only by special values of the electric and magnetic constants.

Such an assumption is inconsistent with the admirable theory by which Fresnel[3] had explained the optical behaviour of moving transparent bodies.

It was therefore not surprising that writers subsequent to Hertz should have proposed to replace his equations by others designed to agree with Fresnel's formulae. 

What is the evidence for and against the motion of the aether in and adjacent to moving ponderable bodies in the last decade of the 19th century?

The phenomena of aberration had been explained by Young[4] on the assumption that the aether around bodies is unaffected by their motion.

But Stokes[5] showed in 1845 that this is not the only possible explanation.

For suppose that the motion of the earth communicates motion to the neighbouring portions of the aether; this may be regarded as superposed on the vibratory motion which the aethereal particles have when transmitting light. 

The orientation of the wave-fronts of the light will consequently in general be altered; and the direction in which a heavenly body is seen, being normal to the wavefronts will thereby be allected. 

But if the aethereal motion is irrotational, so that the elements of the aether do not rotate, it is easily seen that the direction of propagation of the light in space is unaffected; the luminous disturbance is still propagated in straight lines from the star, while the normal to the wave-front at any point deviates from this line of propagation by the small angle u/c, where u denotes the component of the aethereal velocity at the point, resolved at right angles to the line of propagation, and c denotes the velocity of light. 

If the aether near the earth is at rest relatively to the earth's surface, the star will appear to be displaced towards the direction in which the earth is moving, through an angle measured by the ratio of the velocity of the earth to the velocity of light, multiplied by the sine of the angle between the direction of the earth's motion and the line joining the earth and star. 
- This is precisely the law of aberration.

An objection to Stokes's theory has been pointed out by several writers, amongst others by H. A. Lorentz.[6]

This is, that the irrotational motion of an incompressible fluid is completely determinate when the normal component of the velocity at its boundary is given: so that if the aether were supposed to have the same normal component of velocity as the earth, it would not have the same tangential component of velocity. 

It follows that no motion will in general exist which satisfies Stokes's conditions. The difficulty is not solved in any very satisfactory fashion by either of the suggestions which, have been proposed to meet it.

One of those is to suppose that the moving earth does generate a rotational disturbance, which, however, being radiated away with the velocity of light, does not affect the steadier irrotational motion; the other, which was advanced by Planck,[7] is that the two conditions of Stokes's theory—namely, that the motion of the aether is to be irrotational and that at the earth's surface its velocity is to be the same as that of the earth—may both be satisfied if the aether is supposed to be compressible in accordance with Boyle's law, and subject to gravity, so that round the earth it is compressed like the atmosphere; the velocity of light being supposed independent of the condensation of the aether.


<!-- [8] called attention to the defects of Stokes's theory. He  -->
Lorentz combined the ideas of Stokes and Fresnel, by assuming that:
- the aether near the earth is moving irrotationally (as in Stokes's theory)
- but the aether at the surface of the earth the aethereal velocity is not necessarily the same as that of ponderable matter
- a material body imparts the fraction `(μ2 - 1)/μ2` of its own motion to the aether within it (as in Fresnel's theory). 

Fresnel's theory is a particular case of this new theory, being derived from it by supposing the velocity-potential to be zero.

Aberration is not the only astronomical phenomenon which depends on the speed of light.
- This velocity was originally determined by observing the retardation of the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites.

Maxwell[10] said in 1879 that these eclipses theoretically help determine the velocity of the solar system relative to the aether.
- If the distance from the eclipsed satellite to the earth be divided by the observed retardation in time of the eclipse, the quotient then represents the speed of light in this direction, relative to the solar system.

This will differ from the speed of light relative to the aether by the component, in this direction, of the sun's velocity relative to the aether. 

By taking observations when Jupiter is in different signs of the zodiac, it should therefore be possible to determine the sun's velocity relative to the aether, or at least that component of it which lies in the ecliptic.

The same principles may be applied to the discussion of other astronomical phenomena. 

Thus, the minimum of a variable star of the Algol type will be retarded or accelerated by an interval of time which is found dividing the projection of the radius from the sun to the earth on the direction from the sun to the Algol variable by the velocity, relative to the solar system, of propagation of light from the variable. Thus, the latter quantity may be deduced from observations of the retardation.[11]

Another instance in which the time taken by light to cross an orbit influences an observable quantity is afforded by the astronomy of double stars.

Savary[12] long ago remarked that when the plane of the orbit of a double star is not at right angles to the line of sight, an inequality in the apparent motion must be caused by the circumstance that the light from the remoter star has the longer journey to make.

Yvon Villarceau[13] showed that the effect might be represented by a constant alteration of the elliptic elements of the orbit (which alteration is of course beyond detection), together with a periodic inequality, which may be completely specified by the following statement: the apparent coordinates of one star relative to the other have the values which in the absence of this effect they would have at an earlier or later instant, differing from the actual time by the amount

where `m1`, and `m2` denote the masses of the stars, `c` the speed of light, and `z` the actual distance of the 2 stars from each other at the time when the light was emitted, resolved along the line of sight. In the existing state of double-star astronomy, this effect would be masked by errors of observation.

Villarceau also examined the consequences of supposing that the speed of light depends on the speed of the light source.

If the speed of light from a star occulted by the moon were less than the velocity of light reflected by the moon, then the apparent position of the lunar disk would be more advanced in its movement than that of the star, so that at emersion the star would first appear at some distance outside the lunar disk, and at immersion the star would be projected on the interior of the disk at the instant of its disappearance. 

The amount by which the image of the star could encroach on that of the disk on this account could not be so much as 0″·71; encroachment to the extent of more than 1″ has been observed, but is evidently to be attributed for the most part to other causes.


## Doppler

Among the consequences of the finite speed of light which are of importance in astronomy, a leading place must be assigned to the principle enunciated in 1842 by Christian Doppler,[14] that the motion of a source of light relative to an observer modifies the period of the disturbance which is received by him. 

The phenomenon resembles the depression of the pitch of a note when the source of sound is receding from the observer. 

In either case, the period of the vibrations perceived by the observer is `(c + v)/c ×` the natural period, where v denotes the velocity of separation of the source and observer, and c denotes the velocity of propagation of the disturbance. 

If, e.g., the velocity of separation is equal to the orbital velocity of the earth, the D lines of sodium in the spectrum of the source will be displaced towards the red, as compared with lines derived from a terrestrial sodium flame, bs about one-tenth of the distance between them. 

The application of this principle to the determination of the relative velocity of stars in the line of sight, which has proved of great service in astrophysical research, was suggested by Fizeau in 1848.[15]

<!-- Passing now from the astronomical observatory, we must examine the information which has been gained in the physical laboratory regarding the effect of the earth's motion on optical phenomena. We have already[16] referred to the investigations by which the truth of Fresnel's formula was tested.  -->

An experiment of a different type was suggested in 1852 by Fizeau,[17] who remarked that, unless the aether is carried along by the earth, the radiation emitted by a terrestrial source should have different intensities in different directions. 

It was, however, shown long afterwards by Lorentz[18] that such an experiment would not be expected on theoretical grounds to yield a positive result; the amount of radiant energy imparted to an absorbing body is independent of the earth's motion. 

A few years later Fizeau investigated[19] another possible effect. 

If a beam of polarized light is sent obliquely through a glass plate, the azimuth of polarization is altered to an extent which depends, amongst other things, on the refractive index of the glass. 

Fizeau performed this experiment with sunlight, the light being sent through the glass in the direction of the terrestrial motion, and in the opposite direction; the readings seemed to differ in the two cases, but on account of experimental difficulties the result was indecisive.

Some years later, the effect of the earth's motion on the rotation of the plane of polarization of light propagated along the axis of a quartz crystal was investigated by Mascart.[20] 

The result was negative, Mascart stating that the rotation could not have been altered by more than the (1/40,000)th part when the orientation of the apparatus was reversed from that of the terrestrial motion to the opposite direction. This was afterwards confirmed by Lord Rayleigh,[21] who found that the alteration, if it existed, could not amount to (1/100,000)th part.

In terrestrial methods of determining the velocity of light the ray is made to retrace its path, so that any velocity which the earth might possess with respect to the luminiferous medium would affect the time of the double passage only by an amount proportional to the square of the constant of aberration.[22] 

In 1881, however, A. A. Michelson[23] remarked that the effect, though of the second order, should be manifested by a measurable difference between the times for rays describing equal paths parallel and perpendicular respectively to the direction of the earth's motion. 

Ho produced interference-fringes between two pencils of light which had traversed paths perpendicular to each other; but when the apparatus was rotated through a right angle, so that the difference would be reversed, the expected displacement of the fringes could not be perceived. 

This result was regarded by Michelson himself as a vindication of Stokes's theory,[24] in which the aether in the neighbourhood of the earth is supposed to be set in motion. 

Lorentz[25], however, showed that the quantity to be measured had only half the value supposed by Michelson, and suggested that the negative result of the experiment might be explained by that combination of Fresnel's and Stokes's theories which was developed in his own memoir[26]; since, if the velocity of the aether near the earth were (say) half the earth's velocity, the displacement of Michelson's fringes would be insensible.

<!-- A sequel to the experiment of Michelson and Morley was performed -->

In 1897 Michelson[27] tried to determine by experiment whether the relative motion of earth and aether varies with the vertical height above the Earth. 

No result, however, could be obtained to indicate that the velocity of light depends on the distance from the centre of the earth. 

Michelson concluded that if there were no choice but between the theories of Fresnel and Stokes, it would be necessary to adopt the latter, and to suppose that the earth's influence on the aether extends [errata 1] to many thousand kilometres above its surface. 

<!-- By this time, however, as will subsequently appear, a different explanation was at hand. -->

The perplexity of the subject was increased by experimental results which pointed in the opposite direction to that of Michelson. 

In 1892, Sir Oliver Lodge[28] observed the interference between the 2 portions of a bifurcated beam of light, which were made to travel in opposite directions round a closed path in the space between two rapidly rotating steel disks.

These showed that the speed of light is not affected by the motion of adjacent matter to the extent of (1/200)th part of the velocity of the matter.

Continuing his investigations, Lodge[29] strongly magnetized the moving matter (iron in this experiment), so that the light was propagated across a moving magnetic field; and electrified it so that the path of the beams lay in a moving electrostatic field; but in no case was the velocity of the light appreciably affected.

Theoretical physicists arrived at a solution of the apparent contradictions furnished by experiments with moving bodies and extended the domain of electrical science. This enlarged the boundaries of space and time to contain it.

The first memoir in which the new conceptions were unfolded was published by H. A. Lorentz[30] in 1892. 

The theory of Lorentz was, like those of Weber, Riemann, and Clausius,[31] a theory of electrons. 

All electrodynamical phenomena were ascribed to the agency of moving electric charges, which were supposed in a magnetic field to experience forces proportional to their velocities, and to communicate these forces to the ponderable matter with which they might be associated.[32]

<!-- The earlier theories of electrons failed to fulfil the expectations of their authors, the -->

Physicists assumed that all electric and magnetic phenomena are due to the presence or motion of individual electric charges. 

<!-- was one to which physicists were at this time disposed to give a favourable consideration, for, as we have seen,[33] evidence of the atomic nature of electricity was now contributed by the study of the conduction of electricity through liquids and gases.  -->

Moreover, the discoveries of Hertz[34] had shown that a molecule which is emitting light must contain some system resembling a Hertzian vibrator. 

The essential process in a Hertzian vibrator is the oscillation of electricity to and fro. 

Lorentz himself from the outset of his career[35] had supposed the interaction of ponderable matter with the electric field to be effected by the agency of electric charges associated with the material atoms.

The principal difference by which the theory now advanced by Lorentz is distinguished from the theories of Weber, Riemann, and Clausius, and from Lorentz' own earlier work, lies in the conception which is entertained of the propagation of influence from one electron to another. 

In the older writings, the electrons were assumed to be capable of acting on each other at a distance, with forces depending on their charges, mutual distances, and velocities

In the present memoir, on the other hand, the electrons were supposed to interact not directly with each other, but with the medium in which they were embedded. 

To this medium were ascribed the properties characteristic of the aether in Maxwell's theory.

The only respect in which Lorentz' medium differed from Maxwell's was in regard to the effects of the motion of bodies.
