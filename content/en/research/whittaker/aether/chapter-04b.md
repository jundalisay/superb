Laplace's theory was promptly attacked by Young,[23] who pointed out the improbability of such a system of forces as would be required to impress the requisite change of velocity on the light-corpuscles. 

Young's paper failed to convince the contemporary world.

but it permanently enriched science by proposing a dynamical foundation for double refraction on the principles of the wave-theory. "A solution," he says, "might be deduced upon the Huygenian principles, from the simplest possible supposition, that of a medium more easily compressible in one direction than in any direction perpendicular to it, as if it consisted of an infinite number of parallel plates connected by & substance somewhat less elastic Such a structure of the elementary atoms of the crystal may be understood by comparing them to a block of wood or of mica Mr. Chladni found that the mere obliquity of the fibres of a rod of Scotch fir reduced the velocity with which it transmitted sound in the proportion of 4 to 5. It is therefore obvious that a block of such wood must transmit every impulse in spheroidal—that is, oval—undulations, and it may also be demonstrated, as we shall show at the conclusion of this article, that the spheroid will be truly elliptical when the body consists either of plane and parallel strata, or of equidistant fibres, supposing both to be extremely thin, and to be connected by a less highly elastic substance; the spheroid being in the former case oblate and in the latter oblong." Young then proceeds to a formal proof that "an impulse is propagated through every perpendicular section of a lamellar elastic substance in the form of an elliptic undulation." This must be regarded as the beginning of the dynamical theory of light in crystals. It was confirmed in a striking way not long afterwards by Brewster,[24] who found that compression in one direction causes an isotropic transparent solid to become doubly-refracting.

Meanwhile, in January, 1808, the French Academy had proposed as the subject for the physical prize in 1810, "To furnish a mathematical theory of double refraction, and to confirm it by experiment." Among those who resolved to compete was Étienne Louis Malus (b. 1775, d. 1812), a colonel of engineers who had seen service with Napoleon's expedition to Egypt. While conducting experiments towards the end of 1808 in a house in the Rue des Enfers in Paris, Malus happened to analyse with a rhomb of Iceland spar the light of the setting sun reflected from the window of the Luxembourg, and was surprised to notice that the two images were of very different intensities. Following up this observation, he found that light which bad been reflected from glass acquires thereby a modification similar to that which Huygens had noticed in rays which have experienced double refraction, and which Newton had explained by supposing rays of light to have "sides." This discovery appeared so important that without waiting for the prize competition he communicated it to the Academy in December, 1808, and published it in the following month.[25]

"I have found," he said, "that this singular disposition, which has hitherto been regarded as one of the peculiar effects of double refraction, can be completely impressed on the luminous molecules by all transparent solids and liquids." "For example, light reflected by the surface of water at an angle of 52°45' has all the characteristics of one of the beams produced by the double refraction of Iceland spar, whose principal section is parallel to the plane which passes through the incident ray and the reflected ray. If we receive this reflected ray on any doubly-refracting crystal, whose principal section is parallel to the plane of reflexion, it will not be divided into two beams as a ray of ordinary light would be, but will be refracted according to the ordinary law."

After this Malus found that light which has been refracted at the surface of any transparent substance likewise possesses in some degree this property, to which he gave the name polarization. The memoir[26] which he finally, submitted to the Academy, and which contains a rich store of experimental and analytical work on double refraction, obtained the prize in 1810; its immediate effect as regards the rival theories of the ultimate nature of light was to encourage the adherents of the corpuscular doctrine; for it brought into greater prominence the phenomena of polarization, of which the wave-theorists, still misled by the analogy of light with sound, were unable to give any account.

The successful discoverer was elected to the Academy of Sciences, and became a member of tho celebrated club of Arcueil.[27] But his health, which had been undermined by the Egyptian campaign, now broke down completely; and lie died, at the age of thirty-six, in the following year.

The polarization of a reflected ray is in general incomplete i.e. the ray displays only imperfectly the properties of light which has been polarized by double refraction, but for one particular angle of incidence, which depends on the reflecting body, the polarization of the reflected ray is complete. Malus measured with considerable accuracy the polarizing angles for glass and water, and attempted to connect them with the other optical constants of these substances, the refractive indices and dispersive powers, but without success. The matter was afterwards taken up by David Brewster (b. 1781, d. 1868), who in 1815[28] showed that there is complete polarization by reflexion when the reflected and refracted rays satisfy the condition of being at right angles to each other.

Almost at the same time Brewster made another discovery which profoundly affected the theory of double refraction. It had till then beer believed that double refraction is always of the type occurring in Iceland spar, to which Huygens' construction is applicable. Brewster now found this belief to be erroneous, and showed that in a large class of crystals there are two axes, instead of one, along which there is no double refraction. Such crystals are called biaxal, the simpler type to which Iceland spar belongs being called uniaxal.

The wave-theory at this time was still encumbered with difficulties. Diffraction was not satisfactorily explained; for polarization no explanation of any kind was forthcoming; the Huygenian construction appeared to require two different luminiferous media within doubly refracting bodies; and the universality of that construction had been impugned by Brewster's discovery of biaxal crystals.

The upholders of the emission theory were emboldened by the success of Laplace's theory of double refraction. In March 1817, they proposed Diffraction as the subject of the Academy's prize for 1818. Within just 7 years, the corpuscular theory was completely overthrown.

<!-- Their expectation was disappointed; and the successful memoir afforded the first of a series of reverses by which, in the short space of -->

The winner was Augustin Fresnel (b. 1788, d. 1827). He was:
- the son of an architect
- a civil engineer in the Government service in Normandy. 

During the brief dominance of Napoleon after his escape from Elba in 1815, Fresnel fell into trouble for having enlisted in the small army which attempted to bar the exile's return.

It was during a period of enforced idleness following on his arrest that he commenced to study diffraction. In his earliest memoir[29] he propounded a theory similar to that of Young, which was spoiled like Young's theory by the assumption that the fringes depend on light reflected by the diffracting edge. 

Observing, however, that the blunt and sharp edges of a knife produce exactly the same. fringes, he became dissatisfied with this attempt, and on July 15th, 1816, presented to the Academy a supplement to his paper,[30] in which, for the first time, diffraction-effects are referred to their true cause—namely, the mutual interference of the secondary waves emitted by those portions of the original wave-front which have not been obstructed by the diffracting Fresnel's method of calculation utilized the principles of both Huygens and Young; he summed the effects due to different portions of the same primary wave-front, with due regard to the differences of phase engendered in propagation.

The sketch presented to the Academy in 1816 was during the next two years developeil into an exhaustive memoir,[31] which was submitted for the Academy's prize.

It so happened that the earliest memoir, which had been presented to the Academy in the autumn of 1815, had been referred to a Commission of which the reporter was François Arago (b. 1786, d. 1853); Arago was so much impressed that he sought the friendship of the author, of whom he was later a strenuous champion.

A champion was indeed needed when the larger memoir was submitted; for Laplace, Poisson, and Biot, who constituted a majority of the Commission to which it was referred, were all zealous supporters of the corpuscular theory. 

During the examination, however, Fresnel was vindicated in a somewhat curious way. He had calculated in the mernoir the diffraction-patterns of a straight edge, of a narrow opaque body bounded by parallel sides, and of a narrow opening bounded by parallel cdges, and had shown that the results agreed excellently with his experimental measures. 

Poisson, when reading the manuscript, happened to notice that the analysis could be extended to other cases, and in particular that it would indicate the existence of a bright spot at the centre of the shadow of a circular screen. He suggested to Fresnel that this and some further consequences should be tested experimentally; this was done, and the results were found to confirm the new theory. 

The concordance of observation and calculation was so admirable in all cases where a comparison was possible that the prize was awarded to Fresnel without further hesitation.

In the same year in which the memoir on diffraction was submitted, Fresnel published an investigation[32] of the influence of the earth's motion on light. We have already seen that aberration was explained by its discoverer in terms of the corpuscular theory, and it was Young who first showed[33] how it may be explained on the wave-hypothesis. "Upon considering the phenomena of the aberration of the stars," he wrote, "I am disposed to believe that the luminiferous aether pervades the substance of all material bodies with little or no resistance, as freely perhaps as the wind passes through a grove of trees." 

In fact, if we suppose the aether surrounding the earth to be at rest and unaffected by the earth's motion, the light-waves will not partake of the motion of the telescope, which we may suppose directed to the true place of the star, and the image of the star will therefore be displaced from the central spider-line at the focus by a distance equal to that which the earth describes while the light is travelling through the telescope. This agrees with what is actually observed.

But a host of further questions now suggest themselves. Suppose, for instance, that a slab of glass with a plane face is carried along by the motion of the earth, and it is desired to adjust it so that a ray of light coming from a certain star shall not be bent when it enters the glass: must the surface be placed at right angles to the true direction of the star as freed from aberration, or to its apparent direction as affectedly aberration? 

The question whether rays coming from the stars are refracted differently from rays originating in terrestrial sources had been raised originally by Michell[34]; and Robison and Wilson[35] had asserted that the focal length of an achromatic telescope should be increased when it is directed to a star towards which the earth is moving, owing to the change in the relative velocity of light. Arago[36] submitted the matter to the test of experiment, and concluded that the light coming from any star behaves in all cases of reflexion and refraction precisely as it would if the star were situated in the place which it appears to occupy in consequence of aberration, and the earth were at rest; so that the apparent refraction in a moving prism is equal to the absolute refraction in a fixed prism. Fresnel now set out to provide a theory capable of explaining Arago's result. To this end he adopted Young's suggestion, that the refractive powers of transparent bodies depend on the concentration of aether within them; and made it more precise by assuming that the aethereal density in any body is proportional to the square of the refractive index, Thus, if c denote the velocity of light in vacuo, and if c1 denote its velocity in a given material body at rest, so that μ = c/σ1 is the refractive index, then the densities ρ and ρ1 of the aether in interplanetary space and in the body respectively will be connected by the relation

Fresnel further assumed that, when a body is in motion, part of the aether within it is carried along-namely, that part which constitutes the excess of its density over the density of aether in vacuo; while the rest of the aether within the space occupied by the body is stationary. Thus the density of aether carried along is (ρ1-ρ) or (μ2 - 1)ρ, while a quantity of aether of density ρ remains at rest. The velocity with which the centre of gravity of the aether within the body moves forward in the direction of propagation is therefore

where ω denotes the component of the velocity of the body in this direction. This is to be added to the velocity of propagation of the light-waves within the body, so that in the moving body the absolute velocity of light is

Many years afterwards Stokes[37] put the same supposition in a slightly different form. Suppose the whole of the aether within the body to move together, the aether entering the body in front, and being immediately condensed, and issuing from it behind, where it is immediately rarefied. On this assumption a mass ρω of aether must pass in unit time across a plane of area unity, drawn anywhere within the body in a direction at right angles to the body's motion; and therefore the aether within the body has a drift-velocity - ωρ/ρ1, relative to the body: sa the velocity of light relative to the body will be c1 - ωρ/ρ1, and the absolute velocity of light in the moving body will be

or

This formula was experimentally confirmed in 1851 by H. Fizeau[38] who measured the displacement of interference fringes formed by light which had passed through a column of moving water.

The same result may easily be deduced from an experiment performed by Hoek.[39] In this a beam of light was divided into two portions, one of which was made to pass through a tube of water AB and was then reflected at a mirror C, the light being afterwards allowed to return to A without passing through the water: while the other portion of the bifurcated beam was made to describe the same path in the reverse order, i.e. passing through the water on its return journey from C instead of on the outward journey. On causing the two portions of the beam to interfere, Hoek found that no difference of phase was produced between them when the apparatus was oriented in the direction of the terrestrial motion.

Let w denote the velocity of the earth, supposed to be directed from the tube towards the mirror. Let c/μ denote the velocity of light in the water at rest, and c/μ + φ the velocity of light in the water when moving. Let l denote the length of the tube. The magnitude of the distance BC does not affect the experiment, so we may suppose it zero. The time taken by the first portion of the beam to perform its journey is evidently

while the time for the second portion of the beam is

The equality of these expressions gives at once, when terms of higher orders than the first in w/c are neglected,

which is Fresnel's expression.[40]

On the basis of this formula, Fresnel proceeded to solve the problem of refraction in moving bodies. Suppose that a prism A0 C0 B0, is carried along by the earth's motion in vacuo, its face A0 C0, being at right angles to the direction of motion; and

A history of the theories of aether and electricity. Whittacker E.T. (1910).pdf
that light from a star is incident normally on this face. The rays experience no refraction at incidence; and we have only to consider the effect produced by the second surface A0B0. Suppose that during an interval τ of time the prism travels from the position A0C0B0 to the position A1C1B1, while the luminous disturbance at C0, travels to B1, and the luminous disturbance at A0 travels to D, so that B1D is the emergent wave-front.

Then we have


If we write 
, and denote the total deviation of the wave-front by δ1, we have

, and therefore (neglecting second-order terms in w/c)

Denoting by δ the value of δ1, when w is zero, we have

Subtracting this equation from the preceding, we have

Now the telescope by which the emergent wave-front B1D is received is itself being carried forward by the earth's motion; and we must therefore apply the usual correction for aberration in order to find the apparent direction of the emergent ray. But this correction is w sin δ/c, and precisely counteracts the effect which has been calculated as due to the motion of the prison. So finally we see that the motion of the earth has no first-order influence on the refraction of light from the stars.

Fresnel inferred from his formula that if observations were made with a telescope filled with water, the aberration would be unaffected by the presence of the water—a result which was verified by Airy[41] in 1871. 

He showed, moreover, that the apparent positions of terrestrial objects, carried along with the observer, are not displaced by the earth's motion; that experiments in refraction and interference are not influenced by any motion which is common to the source, apparatus, and observer; and that light travels between given points of a moving material system by the path of least time. These predictions have also been confirmed by observation: Respighi[42] in 1861, and Hoek[43] in 1868, experimenting with a telescope filled with water and a terrestrial source of light, found that no effect was produced on the phenomena of reflexion and refraction by altering the orientation of the apparatus relative to the direction of the earth's motion. E. Mascart[44] in 1872 discussed experimentally the question of the effect of notion of the source or recipient of light in all its bearings, and showed that the light of the sun and that derived from artificial sources are alike incapable of revealing by diffraction-phenomena the translatory motion of the earth.

The greatest problem now confronting the investigators of light was to reconcile the facts of polarization with the principles of the wave-theory. Young had long been pondering over this, but had hitherto been baffled by it. In 1816 he received a visit from Arago, who told him of a new experimental result which he and Fresnel had lately obtained[45]—namely, that two pencils of light, polarized in planes at right angles, do not interfere with each other under circumstances in which ordinary light shows interference-phenomena, but always give by their reunion the same intensity of light, whatever be their difference of path.

Arago had not long left him when Young, reflecting on the new experiment, discovered the long-sought key to the mystery: it consisted in the very alternative which Bernoulli had rejected eighty year's before, of supposing that the vibrations of light are executed at right angles to the direction of propagation,

Young's ideas were first embodied in a letter to Arago,[46] dated Jan. 12, 1817. "I have been reflecting," he wrote, "on the possibility of giving an imperfect explanation of the affection of light which constitutes polarization, without departing from the genuine doctrine of undulations. It is a principle in this theory, that all undulations are simply propagated through homogeneous mediums in concentric spherical surfaces like the undulations of sound, consisting simply in the direct and retrograde motions of the particles in the direction of the radius, with their concomitant condensation and rarefactions. And yet it is possible to explain in this theory a transverse vibration, propagated also in the direction of the radius, and with equal velocity, the motions of the particles being in a certain constant direction with respect to that radius; and this is a polarization."

In an article on "Chromatics," which was written in September of the same year[47] for the supplement to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, he says:[48] "If we assume as a mathematical postulate, on the undulating theory, without attempting to demonstrate its physical foundation, that a transverse motion may be propagated in a direct line, we may derive from this assumption a tolerable illustration of the subdivision of polarized light by reflexion in an oblique plane," by "supposing the polar motion to be resolved" into two constituents, which fare differently at reflexion.

In a further letter to Arago, dated April 29th, 1818, Young recurred to the subject of transverse vibrations, comparing light to the undulations of a cord agitated by one of its extremities. [49] This letter was shown by Arago to Fresnel, who at once saw that it presented the true explanation of the non-interference of beams polarized in perpendicular planes, and that the latter effect could even be made the basis of a proof of the correctness, of Young's hypothesis: for if the vibration of each beam be supposed resolved into three components, one along the ray and the other two at right angles to it, it is obvious from the Arago-Fresnel experiment that the components in the direction of the ray must vanish: in other words, that the vibrations which constitute light are executed in the wave-front.

It must be remembered that the theory of the propagation of waves in an elastic solid was as yet unknown, and light was still always interpreted by the analogy with the vibrations of sound in air, for which the direction of vibration is the same as that of propagation. It was therefore necessary to give some justification for the new departure. With wonderful insight Fresnel indicated[50] the precise direction in which the theory of vibrations in ponderable bodies needed to be extended in order to allow of waves similar to those of light: "the geometers," he wrote," who have discussed the vibrations of elastic fluids hitherto have taken account of no accelerating forces except those arising from the difference of condensation or dilatation between consecutive layers." He pointed out that if we also suppose the medium to possess a rigidity, or power of resisting distortion, such as is manifested by all actual solid bodies, it will be capable of transverse vibration. The absence of longitudinal waves in the aether he accounted for by supposing that the forces which oppose condensation are far more powerful than those which oppose distortion, and that the velocity with which condensations are propagated is so great compared with the speed of the oscillations of light, that a practical equilibrium of pressure is maintained perpetually.
