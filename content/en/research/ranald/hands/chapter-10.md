THE LINE OF DESTINY
Chapter X.
THE
line of destiny or Saturn (see plate 27, number 4), tells the
plan of life, and whether that plan will be easily fulfilled or meet
with many obstacles. When the destiny line is deep, clear and with-
out interfering cross markings, you may expect a career pursued with
determination and leading to success. It is true that I have oc-
casionally found hands in which this line was entirely lacking, but
such instances are rare.

a break, showing that the interference has directed you into new
endeavors. Whether the change is to your benefit is shown by the
quality of the line, both before and after the break. Should the line
be stronger and clearer when it resumes its course, your new career
be more promising than the abandoned one.
Frequently, I find the line of destiny cut by either the line of
head or the line of heart, sometimes both, with marked breaks oc-

of head, you may be sure that some mistake in judgment has caused
your life's work to be interrupted. If the line of head actually stops
the Saturn line in its ascent (see plate 45), poor judgment has in-
deed seriously blocked your chances of success. Such ill omens are,
however, not permanent unless you allow yourself to be discouraged
by them.

career. Sometimes, the new line is of much better quality than the
one which ended so ominously.
Interference with the line of Saturn from the line of heart shows
emotional unbalance to be the cause of an upset. Here again, as in
the case of hindrance from the line of head, the seriousness of the
break must be judged both from the indications of healing which
are present, such as a square or a parallel line, as well as from the
course and strength of the line of Saturn after the break.
The space between the lines of head and heart is frequently the
least promising portion of the line of destiny. This period corre-
sponds with the ages from about 30 to 45 years, often the most
active of one's life. Whether or not you are able to overcome the

All lines cutting across the line of Saturn weaken it, and their
place of origin will usually explain their nature. Lines rising from the

Lines running into the line of Saturn strengthen it, revealing the
source of the strength they bring by their origin and direction.
Though the line of Saturn does not vary much in its termination,
it may begin from a number of places. Its most usual origin is from
the center of the palm near the wrist. This origin is the normal
