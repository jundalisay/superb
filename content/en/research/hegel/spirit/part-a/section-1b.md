{{< s v="98" >}} The same applies to the Here which is the other form of the This.

For example, the Here is the tree.

I turn around and this truth, the tree, has disappeared. The Here has changed round into a house. 

The Here itself does not disappear. It remains even if the house, tree, etc disappears. 

The This, as the Here, therefore is also mediated simplicity, a Universality.



{{< s v="99" >}} Pure being, then, remains as the essential element for this sense-certainty since sense-certainty in its very nature proves the Universal to be the truth of its object. 

But that pure being is not in the form of something immediate, but of something in which the process of negation and mediation is essential. 

Consequently it is not what we intend or “mean” by being, but being with the characteristic that it is an abstraction, the purely universal. 

Our intended “meaning”, which takes the truth of sense-certainty to be not something universal, is alone left standing in contrast to this empty. indifferent Now and Here.


{{< s v="100" >}} If we compare the relation in which knowledge and the object first stood with the relation they have come to assume in this result, it is found to be just the reverse of what first appeared. 

The object, which professed to be the essential reality, is now the non-essential element of sense-certainty; for the universal, which the object has come to be, is no longer such as the object essentially was to be for sense-certainty. 

The certainty is now found to lie in the opposite element, namely in knowledge, which formerly was the non-essential factor. 

Its truth lies in the object as my (meinem) object, or lies in the “meaning” (Meinen), in what I “mean”; it is, because I know it. Sense-certainty is thus indeed banished from the object, but it is not yet thereby done away with; it is merely forced back into the I. We have still to see what experience reveals regarding its reality in this sense.

{{< s v="101" >}} The force of its truth thus lies now in the I, in the immediate fact of my seeing, hearing, and so on; the disappearance of the particular Now and Here that we “mean” is prevented by the fact that I keep hold on them. The Now is daytime, because I see it; the Here is a tree for a similar reason. 

Sense-certainty, however, goes through, in this connection, the same dialectic process as in the former case. I, this I, see the tree, and assert the tree to be the Here; another I, however, sees the house and maintains the Here is not a tree but a house. Both truths have the same authenticity – the immediacy of seeing and the certainty and assurance both have as to their specific way of knowing; but the one certainty disappears in the other.

{{< s v="102" >}} In all this, what does not disappear is the I qua universal, whose seeing is neither the seeing of this tree nor of this house, but just seeing simpliciter, which is mediated through the negation of this house, etc., and, in being so, is all the same simple and indifferent to what is associated with it, the house, the tree, and so on. I is merely universal, like Now, Here, or This in general. No doubt I “mean” an individual I, but just something as little as I am able to say what I “mean” by Now, Here, so it is impossible in the case of the I too. By saying “this Here”, “this Now”, “an individual thing”, I say all Thises, Heres, Nows, or Individuals. 

In the same way when I say “I”, “this individual I”, I say quite generally “all I's”, every one is “I”, this individual I. When philosophy is.requested, by way of putting it to a crucial test – a test which it could not possibly sustain – to “deduce”, to “construe”, “to find a priori”, or however it is put, a so-called this thing, or this particular man,(4) it is reasonable that the person making this demand should say what “this thing”, or what “this I”, he means: but to say this is quite impossible.


{{< s v="103" >}} Sense-certainty discovers by experience, therefore, that its essential nature lies neither in the object nor in the I; and that the immediacy peculiar to it is neither an immediacy of the one nor of the other. 

For, in the case of both, what I “mean” is rather something non-essential. 

The object and the I are universals, in which that Now and Here and I, which I “mean”, do not hold out, do not exist. We arrive in this way at the result, that we have to put the whole, of sense-certainty as its essential reality, and no longer merely one of its moments, as happened in both cases, where first the object as against the I, and then the I, was to be its true reality. 

Thus, it is only the whole sense-certainty itself which persists therein as immediacy. In consequence, it excludes from itself all the opposition which in the foregoing had a place there.


{{< s v="104" >}} This pure immediacy has nothing more to do with the fact of otherness, with Here in the form of a tree passing into a Here that is not a tree, with Now in the sense of day-time changing into a Now that is night-time, or with there being an other I to which something else is object. 

Its truth stands fast as a self-identical relation making no distinction of essential and non-essential, between I and object, and into which, therefore, in general, no distinction can find its way. 

I, this I, assert, then, the Here as tree, and do not turn round so that for me Here might become not a tree, and I take no notice of the fact that another I finds the Here as not-tree, or that I myself at some other time take the Here as not-tree, the Now as not-day. 

I am directly conscious, I intuit and nothing more, I am pure intuition. I am-seeing, looking. 

For myself I stand by the fact, the Now is day-time, or, again, by the fact the Here is tree, and, again, do not compare Here and Now themselves with one another; I take my stand on one immediate relation: the Now is day.
