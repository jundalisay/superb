<!-- – A – CONSCIOUSNESS (1) -->


## 1. The Object of Sense Certainty

{{< s v="90" >}} Immediate knowledge is the knowledge of the immediate, of what is.

<!-- The knowledge, which is at the start or immediately our object, can be nothing else than just that which is  -->

With immediate knowledge, we immediately accept what is given. We do not alter anything in it.  
<!-- as it is presented before us, and keeping mere apprehension (Auffassen) free from conceptual comprehension (Begreifen). -->


{{< s v="91" >}} Our senses give us concrete and sure content. 
- This gives us an impression that it is the richest and truest kind of knowledge. 

<!-- , to be even a knowledge of endless wealth – a wealth to which we can as little find any limit when we traverse its extent in space and time, where that content is presented before us, as when we take a fragment out of the abundance it offers us and by dividing and dividing seek to penetrate its intent.  -->

This is because it seems that sensory knowledge has not yet dropped anything from the object. 
- It has the object before itself in its entirety and completeness.

This bare fact of sureness <!-- certainty -->, however:
- is really the abstractest and the poorest kind of truth
- merely says regarding what it knows: it exists.
<!-- is; -->

Its only truth is that this sureness was sensed.
<!-- contains solely the being of the fact it knows.  -->

In this case, consciousness takes the shape merely of pure Ego. 
<!-- , on its part, in the case of this form of certainty, -->
- 'I' in such a case am merely qua pure 'This'. 
- The object likewise is merely qua pure 'This'. 


The conscious, sensing I, is certain of this fact before me. But this is not because:
<!-- - I qua consciousness have developed myself in connection with it, or -->
- that consciousness has developed a connection with it, or
 <!-- and in manifold ways set thought to work about it, or  -->
- the relation of that thing was unrelated to other things.
<!-- - the fact, the thing and its distinct qualities, of which I am certain, lacked possible modes of relation and a variety of connections with other things. -->

<!-- Neither has anything to do with the truth sensuous certainty contains.  -->

<!-- Neither the I nor the thing has here the meaning of a manifold relation with a variety of other things, of mediation in a variety of ways.  -->

This sensing 'I':
- does not contain or imply a manifold of ideas
- does not think about the multiplicity of qualities of the thing

Instead, this sensing 'I' merely says that the thing or the fact exists. 


Existence is the essential point for sense-knowledge. 
- The truth in sense-knowledge is the simple immediacy of the existence of something. 

<!-- In the same way, the certainty qua relation, the certainty “of” something, is an immediate pure relation.  -->

In the same way, the certainty “of” something is an immediate pure relation. 

Consciousness is I* – nothing more, a pure this. 

<!-- > *Superphysics note: Here Kant confuses consciousness for identity and the ego -->


The individual consciousness knows a pure this, or knows what is individual.


{{< s v="92" >}} But, when we look closely, there is much more implied in that bare pure being. 
<!-- , which constitutes the kernel of this form of certainty. -->
<!-- , and is given out by it as its truth. -->

A concrete actual certainty of sense is not merely this pure immediacy.
- It is but an example, an instance, of that immediacy. 

<!-- Amongst the innumerable distinctions that here come to light, we find in all cases  -->

The fundamental difference is that in sense-experience, pure being immediately breaks up into the 2 “thises”:

1. The 'I'
2. The object of the 'I'

<!-- When we reflect(2) on this distinction, neither of them is merely immediate, in sense-certainty. But at the same time, they are mediated.

I have the certainty through the other [object of the I] through the actual fact. 

This, again, exists in that certainty through an other, as the 'I'. -->


{{< s v="93" >}} 

This is the distinction between:
- essential truth and particular example
- essence and instance
- immediacy and mediation. 

We find this in sense-certainty itself. It has to be taken up in the form in which it exists there, not as we have just determined it. 
- One of them is put forward in it as existing in simple immediacy, as the essential reality, the object. 
- The other, however, is put forward as the non-essential, as mediated, something which is not per se in the certainty. 

But there, through something else, ego, a state of knowledge which only knows the object because the object is, and which can as well be as not be.

The object, however, is the real truth, is the essential reality. It is, quite indifferent to whether it is known or not. It remains and stands even though it is not known, while the knowledge does not exist if the object is not there.


{{< s v="94" >}} Thus, we have to consider whether the object it exists in sense-certainty itself

 as such an essential reality as that certainty gives it out to be; whether its meaning and notion, which is to be essential reality, corresponds to the way it is present in that certainty. 

To do this, we do not need to reflect about it and ponder what it might be in truth. Instead, we deal with it merely as sense-certainty contains it.



{{< s v="95" >}} What is the This or the Sense-certainty itself? 

It exists in a two-fold form as:
- the Now
- the Here

Its dialectic will take a form as intelligible as the This itself.

What is the Now?

The Now is night-time, for example. 

To test the truth of this sense-certainty, a simple experiment is all we need: **write that truth down**. 

A truth cannot lose anything by being written down, and just as little by our preserving and keeping it. 

We  then look at the truth we have written down now, at this noon-time. We say it has turned stale and become out of date.


{{< s v="96" >}} The Now that is night is kept fixed. The night-Now is still the night-Now, but not the noon-Now. The noon-Now maintains itself. 
<!-- , i.e. it is treated as what it is given out to be, as something which is; but it proves to be rather a something which is not.  -->

The Now itself no doubt maintains itself, but as what is not night; similarly in its relation to the day which the Now is at present, it maintains itself as something that is also not day, or as altogether something negative. 

This self -maintaining Now is therefore not something immediate but something mediated. 

; for, qua something that remains and preserves itself, it is determined through and by means of the fact that something else, namely day and night, is not.

Thereby, Now is indifferent to what is still associated with it. Now has also day and night as its being. 

<!-- ; just as little as night or day is its being, it is just as truly also day and night; i -->
- It is not at all affected by this otherness, as either night or day, through which it is what it is. 

A 'Universal' is a simple entity of this sort. 
- Through negation, it is neither this nor that. 

<!-- , which is a not-this, and with equal indifference this as well as that – a thing of this kind we call .  -->

A Universal is therefore the truth of sense-certainty, the true content of sense-experience.


{{< s v="97" >}} Sensuous fact is also a Universal. 

 <!-- too, that we(3) give utterance to .  -->

What we say is: “This”, i.e. the universal this; or we say: “it is”, i.e. being in general. 

Of course we do not present before our mind in saying, so the universal this, or being in general, but we utter what is universal; 

In other words, we do not actually and absolutely say what in this sense-certainty we really mean. 

Language, however, is the more truthful. 

In it we ourselves refute directly and at once our own “meaning”; and since universality is the real truth of sense-certainty, and language merely expresses this truth, it is not possible at all for us even to express in words any sensuous existence which we “mean”.
