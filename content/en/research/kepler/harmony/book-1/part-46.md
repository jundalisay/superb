The division of any arc of a circle into three, five, seven, and so on, equal parts, and in any ratio which is not obtainable by repeated doubling from the ones which have been shown above, cannot be carried out in a Geometrical manner which produces knowledge.

The division of an arc into two, four and eight parts, and so on, that is into a repeatedly doubled number of parts, can be carried out Geometrically, and has been used so far. It happens that not only the complete circle can be cut into three parts, by the Trigon; but also the Semicircle, as for the Hexagon; 

and also a quarter [of the circle], as for the Dodecagon; and also a fifth, as for
the Pentehaedecagon; and also the arc of 135 degrees, as in the Octagon; and
also the arc of 108 degrees, as in the Decagon. Indeed, it happens similarly
that not only the complete circle can be cut into five parts, by the Pentagon;
but also the semicircle, as for the Decagon; and also a third part of the circle,
as for the Pentehaedecagon; and also the arc of 150 degrees, as for the Dodeca­
gon. The same is true for the halves of these arcs, and for the quarters, and
for all other parts obtainable by successive halving. But this does not come about
because of a characteristic of Trisection and Quinsection, but by chance, and
on account of the other properties of the figures, as already discussed.

But in the general case trisection, or division in any other proposed ratio
not obtainable by repeated doubling, is impossible, as can be seen by comparison
with the possibility of bisection. For that, the means used to bisect the arc, and
the angle that it measures, is the straight line subtended by the arc, which [i£.
the straight line] can be divided into two equal parts Geometrically: since from
the equality of these two parts it follows that the parts of any arc are equal,
whether it be large or small with respect to the whole circle: and from this start­
ing point we may also deduce that in a Triangle one may argue from the equality
of sides to the equality of the angles opposite them. Now, this means [i.e. the division of the subtended line] is lacking to us in other types of section. For,
although a straight line, subtended by an arc, can be divided into any number
of [equal] parts, and that Geometrically; yet from any proportion of the parts
of the subtended line (after the proportion of equality) it is not possible to deduce
a corresponding proportion of the parts of the arc; in the same way in the Tri­
angle one may not argue from some proportion among the sides (apart from
the proportion of equality alone) to the same proportion among the angles op­
posite them. For, if the subtended line were, say, divided into three equal parts;
if the lines dividing it have been drawn perpendicular to the chord, the middle
part of the arc will be smaller than the ones to either side; if the dividing lines
come out from the center of the arc [i.e. the center of the circle of which the arc
forms part], the middle part of the arc will be larger than the side ones. Therefore
between the infinite distance^"^^ and the center of the circle, there is a point such
that, if two lines were drawn from it, they would divide the subtended line and
its arc into three equal parts. In fact, this point is always further from the arc
of the circle as the arc of the circle that is to be trisected becomes smaller, but
not in constant proportion^^^^ Thus since the arcs of the circle can be made
indefinitely small (minui possunt in infinitum), the distance of this point can
also increase indefinitely (excurret in infinitum): now there is no knowledge
possible of something unbounded or of unbounded variation.^^^ This difficulty

besets even Trisection, which is still simpler and closer to equality [i.e. bisection].
Much greater difficulty will arise in the following divisions of a general arc,
say into 5, 7, 9, 11, etc. equal parts. For there can no longer be a single point
from which the lines are drawn which cut the chord into the required equal
parts while the same lines also cut the arc into equal parts.^^^
Now whatever techniques we can bring to bear to carry out division in
the general case, techniques depending on the number that defines the division,
these techniques must be general and apply equally to the lines subtended by
any arc, both for a large arc which is very different from the line it subtends,
and for a small arc, which differs little from the line. But leaving vague the
ratio of the parts of the chord to the parts of its arc is definitely not a deter­
mination that yields knowledge. And let this be noted particularly for Trisection
or quinsection etc. as carried out by Biirgi's analytical method, which we dis­
cussed at length in the preceding proposition. However all the things said there
apply here also; moreover, some of the things said there are more appropriate
in this place, and become clearer and more significant in the division of arcs
than [they were] in the division of the complete circle. For, if I pass over the

points which the two cases have in common, [namely] that it is begging the
question if we are told to do what it was required to find out how to do: that
the properties of a continuous quantity cannot be given, in a way that produces
knowledge, by discrete quantities or numbers; that whatever number is obtained
for the side which determines the required part of the arc it cannot tell us more
than that the side is either larger or smaller than it should be; that as [the
relationship of] rough and unshaped matter is to something which has form,
and as [the relationship of]an indeterminate and indefinite quantity is to a
figure, so also is [the relationship of] the analytic method to geometrical deter­
mination (the former is particularly excellent and noble in this semimechanical
Cossa, but base and degraded in geometry which produces knowledge); that whereas
every single chord which is less than a diameter is associated with two unequal
arcs of the circle, of which one is smaller than a semicircle, and the other greater,
and therefore the chord of a fractional part of the smaller one is smaller, and
a part which is an equal fraction of the greater one is greater: this Analytic
[method] of Burgi’s tells us something general, not only about these two unequal
chords but also about many other chords of a circle, which is useful for express­
ing [their lengths] in numbers. For example, for trisection the rule (lex) is this:
If the arc be given (let it be 48 degrees) and its chord and let it be required
to divide this arc into three parts, each of 16 degrees; that is if it be required
to find the chord of this part, or its proportion to the whole chord of length
48 degrees: then I am required to make it so that the proportion of the chord
of the whole [arc] to the chord that is to be found, that of the part [of the arc],
is to be equal to the proportion of this chord to the second, and of the second
to the third: now I am required to triple the chord of the part [of the arc], and
from it to subtract the third proportional: the remainder is said to be equal
to the whole chord. That is, from the given chord, one third is cubed, as a frac­
tion, and the resulting number is added to the whole: the third part of this sum
is a little less than the required chord. For if, instead, this [chord] itself, cubed,
is added to the whole; a third part of the sum comes quite close to the correct
value; and this can be repeated, indefinitely. By this procedure one comes gradually
closer to the chord subtended by 16 degrees.^^^ But if you set up the number
that is to be cubed as greater, and in fact to have about the value that the compasses suggest should be a third part of the remainder of the circle when 48
degrees have been subtracted, namely 312 degrees, a third of which is 104: then
in this way you will arrive at the chord of the arc of 104 degrees, and of its
complement 256 degrees. Nor is this all; but if you add to 48 and 312 the com­
plete circle, 360, you will also find the thirds of those .sums, 408 and 6 72, namely
136 and 224, through [i.e. given as the value of] the same Term in the Cossic
relationship.'^^'^ And in general, if one subtracts two from the number that
defines the section, the number of units remaining gives the number of times
one may add the complete circle to the arc it is proposed to divide, so as to dis­
cover the chords of new arcs by means of the same algebraic relationship.^^^
From which it is clear that there is a huge difference between these algebraic
terms and the degrees of knowledge which I discussed above.
But would it not be possible to find a nobler art by which arcs may be divided
into any number of parts? I reply that if all the chords of the arcs that are to
be divided could all be considered in the same manner, and if we only have
techniques applicable in common to all the required chords, as for dividing them
in the required proportion with any number of means in continuous proportion:
then no one will be able to devise anything nobler, and whoever takes any further
pains about the matter is wasting his time; and in his confusion is setting up
the opposite as a predicate."^^^ For from what is common [to all cases], nothing
can be deduced that is applicable in any particular case.
If, however, on the contrary we address ourselves to the specific differences
among the lines subtended by the arcs which are to be divided: then the status
of the question is changed, and in place of the problem of all kinds of division
of an arc we substitute that of dividing the whole circle, using a Regular figure,
which establishes a connection between the proposed chord and its own specific
property: we have already dealt with these Regular figures above and we shall
deal with them more fully below: because in this particular investigation we
were seeking a means by which we may be able to draw some of those figures.
So since such a means must by its nature be prior to the thing that is to be
carried out by it; we should be assuming what we wish to prove if in order to
procure our Means we were to seek the aid of the Regular figures.
Now it might here be argued against me: that Pappus of Alexandria, in
Proposition XXXI of the fourth book of his Mathematical Collection, gives a
way of trisecting an angle using a Hyperbola; and in Proposition XXXV a
way of dividing an angle in any ratio using a (fuadratrix and a Spiral: and
Clavius, in Proposition 25 of Book VIII of his Practical Geometry achieves
the same using the Conchoid of Nicomedes.^

In Truth, what these authors have discovered does not establish that it is
possible to carry out all kinds of division so as to obtain geometrical knowl-
edge.'^^"^ To make this clear I shall first explain Pappus’ mechanical procedures
for trisection: then I shall draw attention to what differentiates them from con­
structions that give knowledge.
Pappus’
First, Pappus himself, in the preamble before proposition 31, divides prob-
trisection of
(which in a more general sense of the word he calls Geometrical, whereas
an angle.
r
i
i ^
jor us the word Geometrical has a more restricted significance) into Plane, Solid
and Linear: and it is stated that Trisection of an angle cannot be carried out
by Plane constructions (which for me are, in the restricted sense. Geometrical,
rigorous, and of the degrees I have explained), and on this he exposes the ill-
conceived attempt of ancient Geometers who here labored in vain.
So he himself carries out his trisection by Solid constructions, and for sec­
tion in general uses curves.
The method of trisection is this. An angle having been proposed for trisec­
tion, from a point on one of the lines enclosing the angle he draws a line per­
pendicular to the other such line, which perpendicular line is understood to
determine the lengths of the lines enclosing the angle. And having drawn lines
parallel to the shorter line and to the perpendicular, the former from the first
point and the latter from the proposed angle, so that they meet and also form
a right angle: now through the foot of the perpendicular he causes there to pass
the surface of a Cone, a solidfigure; then he inclines this applied Cone, or makes
it nod, until with this same surface it defines the section known as a hyperbola
in the plane, such that the two parallels just drawn are Asymptotes to it: then
taking as center the point that is the foot of the perpendicular, with radius twice
the length of the first line enclosing the angle, he draws in the plane an arc,
to cut the line of the Conic section; and joining the center of the arc with that
point of intersection, he draws a line parallel to this [i.e. the join just drawn]
from the proposed angle; having done this he shows that the part cut offfrom
the angle is one third.
Pappus makes this problem a Solid one because he used a Cone, a solid
figure. But insofar as between given Asymptotes (drawn perpendicular to one
arwther) making a right angle, through a given point lying between them, it
is possible to draw the Conic section called a Hyperbolaj^^^ in the planes even
without using a Cone; the problem seems equally to be classifiable as Linear.
For such a line is generated by Geometrical motion, and a continuous change
in distances, that is, it is represented by a collection of points, of indeterminate
number; and this is no less true [of this curve] than of the Quadratrix and
the Spiral, the lines which he [Pappus] uses in Proposition 35 to carry out Trisection and General division [of an angle[. This is Pappus’ mechanical
procedure.'^^^
So what shall we sayf Surely between the given Asymptotes and through
the given point only one Hyperbola can be drawn, whether this be done by ad­
justing the inclination of a Cone or by the infinite continuation of points'? Surely
there is only one point of intersection of circle and Hyperbola on one side. Surely
there is only one, definite, angle made between the line that connects the points
of the Hyperbola and the diameter of the figure?^^^
Indeed, I affirm that all these things are necessary and certain if the Hyper­
bola has actually been drawn. For earlier also, in Biirgi’s analytical trisection,
the third part obtained on the chord bore a certain and necessary length or
proportion in regard to the chord of the whole arc. But because we are not in­
vestigating what it will be, once the construction is carried out, but rather by
what means, in order to give it existence, a thing not yet constructed is to be
constructed: accordingly, we get nothing more from the Solid and Linear Prob­
lems of the ancients, as far as obtaining knowledge of the required line is con­
cerned, than we got before from the Analytical method of the moderns. There
is clearly only one line of a Hyperbola [that lies] between the given Asymptotes,
passes through the given point, and can be drawn in their plane. But when
it is not yet drawn, I am required to adjust the inclination of the Cone over
the point of application until it [the hyperbola] comes into being and is drawn:
alternatively, not using the Cone, lam required to change the construction lines
that plot the Hyperbola by repeatedly finding points, until the curve is long
enough: and the parts that lie between the points I have plotted I am required
to suppose to have been plotted also: in either case, I am required to pass over
by a single act or motion something which potentially involves infinite division;
so that by this passage something may be attained which is concealed in that
potential infinity, without the light of perfect knowledge, which the problems
the ancients dubbed Plane do have.
This kind of postulate is used frequently by Francois Viete, a Frenchman,
and Dutch (Belgici) Geometers of our dayj^^^ in solutions of their problems,which by their very nature are not soluble except in a way that goes against
the rules of the art^‘^ such as numerically or by Geometrical motions whose
changes need to be guided by some kind of infinity.
Now, in a case where everything is available that was considered conducive
to achieving certainty we shall arrive at a result which is either a little greater
or a little smaller than the required value, and always [becomes] closer to it;
as we also said before in relation to the Analytic method of trisection.
That what I say about this solid problem of Trisection is true is, as it were,
su^ested by the very word “solid.” For if a proportion between solids is not given
in a form such as [a ratio between] two cubic numbers: we cannot, as an in­
tellectual procedure, measure the proposed solid in terms of the other one: be­
cause two intermediate proportionals cannot be constructed exactly in the plane:
though they may be present in the cubes, yet there is no passage from the plane
figures to form any of those cubes without the two means: [it is] as if the bridge
were broken.^^^
And for finding two mean proportionals some give instructions to use Geo­
metrical motion, thereby ordering one to do something that is useless for achiev­
ing certainty through an appropriate Geometrical act: indeed Pappus himself
gives instructions that use Conic sections, to be produced with the help of two
[mean] proportionals, although the Cone itself is a solid. So we are always assuming
what it is required to prove; and the bridge lies on the other bank
