We must seek the causes of the harmonic proportions in the divisions of a circle into equal aliquot parts, which are made geometrically and knowably, that is, from the constructible regular plane figures. 

I thus considered that to start with it should be intimated that the features which distinguish geometrical objects to the mind are today, as far as is apparent from published books, totally unknown. 

In fact not even among the ancients is anyone found who has intimated that he knew exactly these specific distinguishing features of geometrical objects, except for Euclid and his commentator Proclus. 

In Pappus the Alexandrine and the ancients who follow him the division of problems into plane, solid, and linear is sufficiently appropriate for explaining the mental attitudes which arise in connection with every single part of the subject of geometry.

However it is both brief in words and applied to practice: no mention is made of theory, and yet
unless we engage with our whole minds in the theory of this matter
we shall never be able to take in the harmonic ratios. Proclus Diadochus
in the four books which he published on the first book of Euclid ex­
plicitly played the part of a theoretical philosopher dealing with a
mathematical subject. If he had left to us his commentaries on the
tenth book of Euclid as well, he would both have freed our geometers
from ignorance, if he had not been neglected, and relieved me totally
from this toil of explaining the distinguishing features of geometrical
objects. For from the very outset it is readily apparent that those dis­
tinctions between entities of the mind would have been known, since
he established the basic principles of the whole essence of mathe­
matics as the same which also pervade all entities and generate them
all from themselves, that is to say the end and the endless, or the limit
and the unlimited, recognizing the limit or boundary as the form,
the unlimited as the matter of geometrical objects.
For shape and proportion are properties of quantities, shape of
individual quantities and proportion of quantities in combination.
Shape is demarcated by limits, for it is by points that a straight line,
by lines that a plane surface, by surfaces that a solid is bounded, cir­
cumscribed, and shaped. Therefore finite things which are circum­
scribed and shaped can also be grasped by the mind: infinite and un­
bounded things, insofar as they are such, can be held in by no bonds
of knowledge, which is obtained from definitions, by no bonds of con­
structions. For shapes are in the archetype prior to their being in the
product, in the divine mind prior to being in creatures, differently indeed in respect of their subject, but the same in the form of their
essence. Therefore in quantities shape is a kind of mental essence of
them, or understanding is their essential distinguishing feature. That
is much clearer from the case of proportions. For since shape is de­
marcated by several limits, it comes about that on account of their
being plural shape partakes of proportions. However what proportion
is without the action of the mind is something which cannot be under­
stood in any way. Hence by the same reasoning, one who gives limits
to quantities as their essential basis supposes that quantities which
have shapes have an intellectual essence. But there is no need for argu­
ments: Proclus’ whole book should be read. It will be sufficiently evident
that the intellectual distinguishing features of geometrical objects were
properly known to him, although he does not make such an open and
conspicuous declaration of that point as a separate thing on its own,
so as to put even a dozing reader in mind of it. For his eloquence
flows as if in full flood, completely swathed in most plentiful doctrines
of rather abstruse Platonic philosophy; and among them is this point,
which is the single argument of this Book.
However this our age has had no room hitherto for penetration
to such hidden mysteries. The book of Proclus was read by Petrus
Ramus,'^ but as far as the core of philosophy is concerned, it was de­
spised and rejected equally with the tenth Book of Euclid; and he who
had written a commentary on Euclid was repudiated and instructed
Petrus Ramus’
to lose his voice, as if he had written a defense for him. Indeed the
unjust and
peevish anger of a hostile critic turns against Euclid as if he were on
criticism trial: the tenth Book of Euclid was condemned to the atrocious sen-
of Euclid,
tence of not being read, though if it were read and understood it could
lay bare the secrets of philosophy. Read, I ask you, the words of Ramus,
than which he has never uttered anything more unworthy of Ramus.
(ScholaeMathematicae {MathematicalSchools), Book 21.) ''The material” he
says, "which is the subject of Book X, is conveyed in such a way that I have
never found the same obscurity in literature or the arts — obscurity, I mean,
not for the understanding of what Euclid is saying (for that may be quite clear
to the unlearned and unlettered if they pay attention to it, that is only what
is there and what is present in the text) but for thoroughly understanding and
investigating what end and what purpose are intended for the work, what the
kinds, species and distinguishing features of the objects under discussion are;
for I have never read or heard anything so confused or involved. Furthermore
the superstition of the Pythagoreans seems to have invaded this, so to speak, cave.”
But, my goodness, Ramus, if you had not believed that this book was too hard to understand, you would never have slandered it with
the accusation of such obscurity. There is need for harder work, need
for tranquillity, need for concentration, and above all for mental ex­
ertion, until you grasp the writer’s intention. When the superior mind
has struggled to that point, then at last, seeing that it has reached the
light of truth, it is exultantly flooded with incredible pleasure, and
in that, as it were, watch tower, it perceives with great precision the
whole world and all the distinguishing features of its parts. But to you,
who here act as the patron of ignorance, and to the common herd
of men who snatch at profit from everything, divine or human, to you,
I say, belong the phrases “prodigious sophisms,” to you “Euclid incon­
tinently abusing his leisure,” to you “these subtleties have no place in
geometry.” Let your part be to carp at what you do not understand:
for me, a hunter for the causes of things, no other paths to them had
opened but in the tenth Book of Euclid.
Following Ramus, Lazarus Schoner in his Geometry^ confessed that
he could see absolutely no use for the five regular solids in the world,
until he perused my little book which I entitled The Secret of the Universe,
in which I prove that the number and distances of the planets were
taken from the five regular solids. See what damage Ramus the master
did to Schoner the disciple. First Ramus, having read Aristotle thor­
oughly, who had refuted the Pythagorean philosophy on the proper­
ties of the elements as deduced from the five solids, at once conceived
in his mind a contempt for the whole of the Pythagorean philosophy;
and then, as he knew that Proclus was a member of the Pythagorean
sect, he did not believe him when he asserted, which was quite true,
that the ultimate aim of Euclid’s work, to which absolutely all the propo­
sitions of all its books were related, was the five regular solids. Hence
there arose in Ramus a very confident conviction that the five solids
must be removed from the aim of the books of the Elements of Euclid.
With the aim of the work removed, as if the form were removed
from a building, there was left a formless heap of propositions in Euclid,
which Ramus attacked as if it were a fiend in all the twenty-eight books
of his Schools, with great harshness of language, with great temerity,
quite undeserved by so great a man. Schoner, following Ramus’ con­
victions, himself also believed (of course) that the regular solids had
no application; and not only that, but he also neglected or despised
Proclus, following the judgement of Ramus. Yet from Proclus he could
learn the application of the five solids both in the Elements of Euclid
and in the structure of the world. In fact the disciple was more fortunate than the n^aster, because he gratefully received my revelation
of the application of the solids in the structure of the world, which
Ramus had repudiated though it was taught by Proclus. For what if
the Pythagoreans attributed these shapes to the elements, but not as
I do to the spheres of the world? Ramus would have striven to undo
this error over the true subject of the figures, as I have done; he would
not have demolished this whole philosophy with one tyrannical word.
What if the Pythagoreans put forward the same teaching as I do, and
hid their doctrine by wrapping it up in words? Is not the Copernican
form of the world found in Aristotle himself, falsely refuted by him
Under Other names, as they called the Sun, Fire, and the Moon the
Counter Earth? For suppose the disposition of the circles was the same
according to the Pythagoreans as according to Copernicus, that the
five solids were known, and the necessity for their fivefold number;
and suppose that they all consistently taught that the five solids were
the archetypes of the parts of the world. What a short step further
it is for us to believe that their doctrine in the form of a riddle was
read by Aristotle as if it had been refuted in the true sense of the words,
when Aristotle read it as the Earth to which they allocated the cube,
although they as it happened meant Saturn, the orbit of which was
separated from Jupiter by the interposition of the cube. And the com­
mon herd ascribe rest to the Earth, whereas Saturn has been allocated
a very slow motion which is very close to rest, so that among the He­
brews it got its name from the word “rest.” Similarly Aristotle read it
as the air to which the octahedron was given, whereas they as it hap­
pened meant Mercury, the orbit of which was enclosed by the octa­
hedron; and Mercury is no less swift than the nimble air is held to
be. As it happened. Mars was the interpretation given to the word “fire,”
which also had elsewhere the name Pyrois (fiery one) from fire; and
to it the tetrahedron was given, perhaps because its orbit is enclosed
by that figure. And under the disguise of water, to which the icosa­
hedron is attributed, the star of Venus (as the one of which the course
is contained within the icosahedron) could be hidden, because liquids
are subject to Venus, and she herself is said to have risen from the
sea foam, whence the name “Aphrodite.” Lastly, the word “world” could
signify the Earth, and that the dodecahedron is ascribed to the world,
because the Earth’s course is contained within that figure, and marked
off into twelve sections of its length, as that figure is contained within
twelve faces round its whole compass. Therefore that in the secrets
of the Pythagoreans on this basis the five figures were distributed not
among the elements, as Aristotle believed, but among the planets them­
selves is very strongly confirmed by the fact that Proclus tells us that
the aim of geometry is to tell how the heaven has received appropriate
figures for definite parts of itself.
Nor is this yet the end of the damage which Ramus has inflicted
on us. Consider the most ingenious of today’s geometers, Snel, clearly
a supporter of Ramus, in his preface to the Problems of Ludolph van


Ceulen.^ First he says, “That division of the inexpressibles into thir- wuiebrord Snei’s
teen kinds is useless for application.” I concede that, if he is to rec- opinion on
11-1
binomials.
ognize no application unless it is in everyday life, and if there is to
be no application of the study of nature to life. But why does he not
follow Proclus, whom he mentions, and who recognizes that there is
some greater good in geometry than those of the arts which are nec­
essary for living? In that case in fact the application of the tenth Book
in deciding the kinds of figures would have been evident. Snel men­
tions geometrical authors who are said to make no use of the tenth
Book of Euclid.’’ Of course all of them deal with either linear or solid
problems, and in connection with such figures or quantities as have
no purpose within themselves, but obviously aim at other applications,
and would not be investigated otherwise. But the regular figures are
investigated on their own account as archetypes, have their own per­
fection within themselves, and are among the subjects of plane prob­
lems, notwithstanding the fact that a solid is also enclosed by plane
faces. In the same way the material of the tenth Book also relates chiefly
to plane surfaces. Why then should those of varying kinds be mentioned?
Or why should the goods which Codrus did not buy to feed his belly
with them, but which Cleopatra bought to ornament her ears, be
reckoned cheap? “Is it only a cross fastened to our talents?”® I say, to
those who molest the inexpressibles with numbers, that is by express­
ing them. But I deal with those kinds not with numbers, not by algebra,
but by mental processes of reasoning, because of course I do not need
them in order to draw up accounts of merchandise, but to explain
the causes of things. He considers that such subtleties should be kept
out of a “primer,” and hidden away in a library. He plays completely
the part of the faithful disciple of Ramus, and shows no mean judge­
ment in placing his effort. Ramus removed the form from Euclid’s
edifice, and tore down the coping stone, the five solids. By their re­
moval every joint was loosened, the walls stand split, the arches threat­
ening to collapse. Snel therefore takes away the stonework as well, see­
ing that there is no application for it except for the stability of the
house which was joined together under the five solids. How fortunate
is the disciple’s understanding, and how dexterously did he learn from


Ramus to understand Euclid: that is, they think that the “Elements”
is so called because there is found in Euclid a wealth of every kind
of propositions and problems and theorems, for every kind of quan­
tities and of the arts concerned with them, whereas the book is called
“Elementary Primer” from its form, because the following proposition
always depends on the preceding one right up to the last one of the
last Book (and partly also that of the ninth Book), which cannot do
without any of the previous ones. Instead of an architect they make
him a builders’ merchant or a bailiff, thinking that Euclid wrote his
book in order to accommodate everybody else, but was the only one
who had no home of his own. But that is quite enough on the subject
at this point: we must return to the main topic of discourse.
For I saw that the true and genuine distinguishing features of geo­
metrical objects, from which I had to draw out the causes of the har­
monic proportions, were totally unknown to the common herd; that
Euclid, whose zeal had handed them on, is being hooted off by the
scoffing of Ramus, and, as he is drowned by the din of frivolous people,
is properly heard by no-one, or is reciting the secrets of philosophy
to the deaf; and that Proclus, who could have opened the mind of
Euclid, disclosed what was hidden, and made easy what was too difficult
to grasp, was being mocked and had not continued his commentaries
right up to the tenth Book. I therefore realized that what I had to do
completely was, to start with, to transcribe from the tenth Book of
Euclid what chiefly related to my present undertaking; also to bring
to light the train of thought of that Book, inserting mention of certain
definite divisions; and to indicate the reasons why some branches of
the divisions were omitted by Euclid. Then, finally, I had to deal with
the figures themselves. There, in cases where Euclid’s demonstrations
were perfectly clear I have been content with a simple reference to
the propositions. Many points which were demonstrated by Euclid
in another way, had here, on account of the aim which I had in view,
that is to say on account of my comparison of knowable and unknow­
able figures, to be repeated, or linked together if they were separated,
or changed in order. I have embraced the series of definitions, propo­
sitions, and theorems in continuous numbering, as I did in the
Dioptrice,'^ for convenience of reference. Also in the actual lemmas I
have not been precise, and have not troubled too much about names,
as I have been more intent on the matters themselves, seeing that I
am now playing the role not of a geometer in philosophy but of a
philosopher in this part of geometry. And I wish I could have made
my discussion still more popular, provided that it were also clearer
and more accessible. But I hope that fair-minded readers will receive
my work kindly on both scores, both because I relate geometrical mat­
ters in a popular way, and because I could not by diligence overcome the obscurity of the material. I also give them this final piece of advice,
that if they are completely unacquainted with mathematical matters,
they should pass over my expositions and read only the propositions,
from X X X to the end; and putting confidence in the propositions them­
selves, without proof, they should pass on to the remaining books,
especially the last. They should not be frightened off by the difficulty
of the geometrical arguments and deprive themselves of the very great
enjoyment of harmonic studies.
