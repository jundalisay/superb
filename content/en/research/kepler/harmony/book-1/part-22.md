So, having dealt with lines commensurable in length, let us go on to
those which are commensurable only in square. 

If two such Expressible lines are combined, they form a Binomial: if they are subtracted
the remainder is an Apotome: there are six subordinate kinds of each,
see propositions 48 and 85 of Book X [of Euclid].

If we combine two such Medials, which either form an Expressible
Rectangle or a Medial one: they will make by addition Bimedials, and
by subtraction Medial Apotomes, the former taking their name from
the Binomials, the latter from the Apotomes.
Here we may not join up an Expressible line with a Medial one:
for two such lines are simply incommensurable, a type that will be
discussed in the following section.


## 23 Proposition

There remain the lines completely incommensurable with one another.

No pair of these can in fact produce the required resultants^^: as they
are both Medial or one is Medial and the other Expressible.
In the one case because the pair is of low standing, in the other because
the natures of the two lines of the pair are different. See Euclid X, 71, 108,
109.^-^ So no kind of combination can be called in here: we are left only with
the lines of lower standing, having excluded the Expressible and the Medial.


## 24 Proposition

From the first pair of such completely incommensurable lines, that is those described in XVII as fifth degree knowable, by adding them or subtracting them there again emerges an Expressible line. 

They are necessarily Binomial and Apotome, see Euclid X, 112, 113, 114. 

As when both the sum of the squares of a Binomial and of an Apotome, and their Rectangle, is Expressible, it is necessary that the individual Terms of the one should be commensurable with the individual Terms of the other, which is not the case for all Binomials and Apotomes. 

Because two such lines which have the two required resultants necessarily form a Binomial and an Apotome; this is proved in the same way as [Euclid] X, 33, except that for two pijrai<; Suvapsi povov [lines expressible only in the power] we use pqxai pqKEi [lines expressible in length] and for the word psaov [medial] we substitute pqxov [expressible]: and finally we use the definition of the Binomial and the Apotome.

By the addition and subtraction of a Binomial and an Apotome, with the required resultants, we get back to an Expressible line is seen as follows. 

For when the sum of the squares is Expressible, and the Rectangle is Expressible; adding the lines together, the square [of the sum] will be composed of the square of each line, and twice the rectangle of the lines, that is, it is composed of two parts which are Expressible: so the whole square will be Expressible: thus so too will be the composite line, whose power is equal to the square. 

Let:
- the Binomial be `Xp`, its square ko
- the apotome be `XO`, its square 6 k 
- `6 k` and `ko` be taken together be Expressible
- the Rectangle made of `OX`, `Xp` also be expressible

Two such rectangles `Kp`, `k ^` complete the whole square of the composite line `Op`, which square is `0o`.

For subtraction the proof is as follows. 

If the line composed of `OX`, `pX`, that is `Op`, is expressible, half of it. On, will also be Expressible (as the larger term) and `nX` the smaller term, and the other half [of Ofj., namely] nii; take from it na equal to the line dX, and the remainder will also be Expressible, and also the complete line `Xo`, that is double the line na. 

But Xo is the remainder after subtracting the Apotome fio from the Binomial Xfx. Thus the remainder is Expressible.

From the second pair of the sixth degree (as in section XVIII) consisting of lines completely incommensurable with one another, the sum of whose squares is Expressible, while their Rectangle is Medial;

by adding them we obtain a Mizon also called a Major; and by subtraction an Elasson or Minor.^® From the third [pair], where the sum of the squares is Medial and the Rectangle is Expressible, what we obtain by addition is called the side of a square that is Expressible and Medial, and what we obtain by subtraction is said to Make a Complete Medial with an Expressible."^® Finally from a fourth pair of the seventh degree (as in section XIX) where each resultant^' is a Medial;

by addition we obtain the side of a square that is Bimedial, and by subtraction [a quantity which is said] to Make with a Medial a Complete Medial."*2


Here is the Origin of the 12 kinds of quantities treated by Euclid and the explanation for their Number. For Euclid did not consider that he needed to go on to consider more remote kinds [of quantities] which as the sum of their squares, or as their common Rectangle, or both, go beyond the Expressible or the Medial to produce still lower kinds of quantity.“^3
