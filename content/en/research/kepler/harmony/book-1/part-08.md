## 8. Measuring Shapes

The quantity of a line is knowable if it is either itself immediately measurable.

The quantity of a surface is knowable if its square is measurable by the diameter.


<!--  square if a surface: or the quantity in question is at least formed from quan­
tities such that by some definite geometrical connection, in some series
[of operations] however long, they at last depend upon the diameter
or its square. The Greek for this is yvcopipov, “intelligible.” -->


## 9. Recreating Measures

The construction of a quantity which is either to be described or to be known is its deduction from the diameter, by permitted means, in Greek [these are called] Kopipa, “practicable.”

So constriction generally yields either description or knowledge. But Description declares mere quantity, whereas knowledge also in addition declares quality or a definite quantity.

A line can be geometrically determined, in Greek raKtri [“fixed”], even though its quality is not yet known intellectually. 

On the other hand, a line or lines may be known qualitatively, but that does not yet determine them or make them determinate, that is to say if their quality is common to many other things which are different in quantity. So for such lines description is easy, knowledge very difficult. Einally, many things can be described by some Geometrical means or other; but cannot be knowable by their nature: as knowledge has been defined above.

## 10. 

We have proper construction when the number either of the angles of the Figure itself, or of the figure related to it by having either double or half its number of sides, forms the middle term in finding the ratio of the side to the Diameter,
For every regular figure is either itself a triangle or can be resolved into triangles by drawing diagonals. Since, however, every such triangle has its three [angles] equal to two right [angles]; so in the [elementary triangle] of the Trigon

the angle is one third, in the elementary triangle of the Tetragon the smallest
angle is one quarter, in the Pentagon one fifth, in the Heptagon one seventh
etc., each fraction being that of two right angles. And it is from the size of the
angle that the construction begins.^^

XI Definition

We have improper construction when the ratio of the side to the diameter cannot immediately be determined Geometrically from the number of the angles, unless the side of another figure is brought in, and this [extra side] is not from the figure with double or half the number of sides [of the original figure].

XII Definition
There are various degrees of knowledge, some distant, some close. The first and closest degree is when I know some line and can show that it is equal to the diameter or that a plane surface, which may be formed
in another way, is equal to the square of the d ia m e te r.^ ^
Here the given measure perfectly, that is of itself and by one act, measures
the thing that is knowable.

XIII Definition

The second degree [of knowledge] is when if the diameter is divided into a certain definite number of equal parts, or its square is similarly divided, then the line or plane surface we are given is equal to one or more such parts. Such a line is called in Greek ^TjXT| giiKei, expressible in length. Such an area is simply called pt|Tov, expressible. For
number is the medium of expression for Geometers.’

We arrive at this degree of knowledge either by description and inscription; or alternatively by its relationship with some other quantity at which we arrive by those means.

And on that account this quality does not determine any quantity; for, as far as I know, it is not sufficient to determine it that I should know something which is compared with it in this way or that for the sake of measurement; I
must also know how, that is by what number, it is expressible.

XIV Definition

The third degree [of knowledge] is when the line is inexpressible in length but its square is Expressible and belongs to the second degree. It is said to be ^>T|Tfi 6uvdgei, “Expressible in square.”


XV Definition

The degrees which follow are all called aXoyoi, “Inexpressible.” Latin translators have rendered this as “Irrational,” running a great risk of ambiguity and absurdity. 

Let us bury this usage, because there are many lines which, although they are Inexpressible, are defined by the best
computations.*’’ Arithmeticians, by a similar translation, refer to
deaf Numbers,*** that is numbers which cannot speak any more than
a deaf man can hear: but under this name they include numbers
Expressible only in square as well as inexpressible quantities.*’ 


Thus the fourth degree in order, and the first in fact o f inexpressible quantities, is when neither the line nor its square is Expressible; but never theless the Square can be transformed into a Rectangle such that its
sides are Expressible at least in square. 

This line is called Medial, because it is a mean proportional between two expressible lines commensurable only in square: as when one is Expressible in length and the other only in square; or if each is Expressible only in square, but
the ratio between the squares is not that of one square number to
another.'^

Such a line is not known or measured by the length of an aliquot part or parts of the diameter, nor is its square [measured by] the square of the diameter; but neither can the two lines between which the Medial is a mean proportional both together be measured by the Diameter; but as for the squares of these lines, these finally can be measured
by the square of the diameter.

The square of a Medial [line] is also itself called Medial, whether it takes the form of a square or turns into a Rectangle: so we have this other type of Area, following the Expressible area: And the following kinds [of area] can be distinguished into these two types of area, the Expressible and the Medial.^*^



XVI Definition

We now come to different individual lines, through the combination of pairs of lines which themselves also introduce new degrees of knowledge. 

For let us cut either a diameter, or a line commensurable with the diameter at least in square and thus Expressible,'^' or even a Medial line; I say let us cut if into two unequal parts, or let there be
made up, from sections of any two such parts of any kind, either by
the addition of parts, or by having their squares formed by addition,
or subtraction, of such [parts], two lines, I say, that are of different
types: they will either be commensurable with one another in length;
or, although incommensurable in length, nevertheless commensurable
in square. 

Here, though the individual lines clearly have moved away from commensurability, yet when some of them are combined, either by their squares being put together, or by their being taken as sides
to a Rectangle, they make up areas, [such as] those already described,
no less than do those [lines] which are commensurable with one an­
other. Since the combination of two such completely incommensurable
lines may take many forms, each sinking lower and lower, we shall not
be able to assign every pair to a single degree.

The word we have translated “medial” is “mese” in the original; that is, Kepler
is using a transliteration of Euclid’s Greek adjective rather than the usual Latin trans­
lation of it. Kepler seems to have worked primarily from the original Greek text of
the Elements (see note 23 below).
>9 If the ratio between the squares were that of one square number to another,
then the original length (taken to be inexpressible) would turn out to be expressible
after all.
In algebraic terms, we have a length, /, whose square is equal to the product of
two numbers p , q each of which is expressible, at least in square. Thus,
I X I = p X q
(1).
This makes I a mean proportional between/? and q, that is, in modern parlance, their
geometric mean.
If the ratio between the squares of p and q is that of one square number to an­
other, we have
( 2 ).
where a , b are integers.
Therefore,^ =
that \sp = ^ x q , where a , b are integers. Substituting in (1)
gives
I X I = - i q X q)
(3).
Now, q is expressible in square (at least), therefore the expression on the right
of equation (3) is the product of two expressible numbers, and thus is itself express­
ible. So the left hand side of the equation must also be expressible. That is, I is ex­
pressible in square —which contradicts our original assumption.

XVII Definition


So let the fifth degree of knowledge be when we have two lines which
are not both Expressible, nor both Medial, and further are completely
incommensurable with one another, and they make both the sum of
their squares and their common rectangle an expressible quantity:
no less than each of these is made by two lines Expressible in length,
by Euclid X.20, or also by two lines expressible only in square, but
commensurable with one another in length, by the same [proposition
of Euclid ].2 2 Thus the side of the square [of area] 2 and the side of
the square [of area] 8 are in double ratio, because the squares are in
the ratio four to one. Thus, although the sides are Inexpressible in
length, they are commensurable with one another. Their squares, 2
and 8, add up to 10, an Expressible area. And if they are multiplied
one by the other (which is to form [them into] a Rectangle) they make
a rectangle of [area] 4, also Expressible. This [i.e. an expressible
rectangle] I say is also made by two lines which are neither Expressible
nor Medial, and further are completely incommensurable with one
another: and for this reason they are not, like the earlier ones, to be
assigned to the second or third degree of knowledge, but to the Fifth.
Note therefore that in this degree we shall measure not the lines
themselves, nor their individual squares, but instead we shall measure



both the Rectangle formed from them and the sum of their squares;
so what is lacking in one square, making it less expressible, is exactly
compensated by the other square that is associated with it.
XVIII Definition
The sixth and lower degree of knowledge is when two lines are joined
which are neither expressible, nor Medial, both together, and are also
incommensurable with one another, and only one of the areas they
make is Expressible, while the other is Medial. There are two cases
[for lines of this degree]; for either the sum of the squares is expres­
sible and the Rectangle is Medial; or the former is Medial and the
latter expressible.
In the former case, the lines are like two expressible lines commensurable
only in square. For both the powers, that is the Expressible squares, also have
a sum that is Expressible in each case. In fact their rectangle is Medial, by
Euclid X, 2 2 P
In the latter case, the lines are like two Medial lines commensurable only
in square, whose ratio to one another is as that of two Expressible lines between
which the first of the two Medials is a mean proportional, by Euclid X, 26
and 28.'^'* For because they are commensurable in square: when added the powers
give a sum commensurable with the parts [i.e. the powers]. But the parts are
Medial, and anything commensurable with a Medial is itself Medial, by Euclid
X, 24:^^^
In this latter case, we are measuring the Rectangle formed by the
two lines by the area of the square of the diameter, but we cannot
also measure the sum of the squares of the lines: for, for that, we can
only find two lines which form a rectangle equal to it, and the squares
of these lines we measure by the square of the diameter.

XIX Definition

The seventh still lower degree of knowledge is when neither resultant
of two mutually incommensurable lines is expressible, neither the sum
of their squares nor their Rectangle: but each is however Medial.
In this case, the lines are like two Medials commensurable only in square,
one of which is to the other as one of those commensurable lines (that is to say
commensurable only in square), between which the Medial truly is a mean propor­
tional, is to some third line, commensurable only in square, by Euclid X, 29.^^
Euclid is particularly concerned with finding these three pairs of lines, dis­
tinguished by making two kinds of area, because they contribute to the com­
position and structuring of following kinds.'^'^

XX Definition

So the eighth degree of knowledge is a continuation of what has gone before, and once more refers to individual lines, but to those which are made up of two terms, namely of two combinations of the pre­
ceding combinations, or by the subtraction of one, called the
Epharmozusa [conjugate], from the other partner, to make a new kind
of line. 

So that for these we know or measure not complete lines, not the squares of complete lines, not pairs of terms taken one from each, but their combined squares and their Rectangle, as in sections XVIII
and X IX above.

And although we can enumerate as many degrees of knowledge as there are kinds [of line], so that the earlier degree is always higher than the later: yet because any addition or subtraction refers to its degree, and no operation of addition or subtraction gives rise to diversity, but all are equally related to their pair of Terms or Elements: on this account we shall make them only one degree: but let us recognize that it contains kinds of lines that differ in standing.


XXI Proposition


<!-- Sic, Euclid, Elements X, 21 in Heath’s translation (see Euclid trans. Heath, vol.
Ill, p. 49) —and in Caspar’s translation of Harmonice mundi, which has similar silent
“corrections” elsewhere (for this one see Weltharmonik, p. 23).
Most of Kepler’s references to individual propositions of the Elements give them
numbers that correspond to those in Heath’s translation (made from Heiberg’s Greek
text). However, the pattern of agreements and divergences between Kepler’s number­
ing and Heath’s indicates that Kepler is referring to the Greek text of the Elements,
edited by Simon Grynaeus, printed byjohannes Hervagius in Basel in 1533. Grynaeus
based his text on Theon’s recension of the Elements. The volume also included the
Greek text of Proclus’ Commentary on the first book of the Elements.
24 Sic, see previous note. As above, Caspar’s translation again contains a silent
“correction.” Euclid, Elements X, 25 and 27 in Heath’s translation; see Euclid trans.

It is required to know that from two lines commensurable with one
another in length nothing can be made which should be taken into
account here, whether the lines are Expressible, or Medial, or of lower
standing.29

For if they are commensurable in length, the whole built up from them will
be commensurable with the parts. Now a line commensurable with an Expres­
sible line is Expressible: by the definitions before Euclid X,20.'^^ And a line com­
mensurable with a Medial line is a Medial by 24 of the same.'^^ And a line
commensurable with any of the Inexpressible lines that follow the Medials is
of the same kind as it is, by 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107 [of Euclid
And so it is also with the other further kinds of line, not
mentioned by Euclid, which make more remote degrees [of knowledge].
And even if it were not so for them, it does not matter to us. For they
either come down to one of the kinds [of line] which we shall now
constitute from incommensurable lines; and thus do not increase the
number [of degrees]: or they make lower kinds of their own or an­
other type; and thus they do not belong at this point, where we are
setting out the degrees which are closest in rank to those already
described.
