<!-- XLV Proposition -->

The Heptagon and all figures the number of whose sides are Primes (so-called), and their stars, and the complete classes [of figures] derived from them, have no Geometrical description independent of the circle: in the circle, although the quantity of the side is determinate, it is equally impossible to evaluate.’^®

This is a matter of importance, for it is on account of this result that the Heptagon and other figures of this kind were not employed by God in ordering the structure of the World, as He did employ the knowable figures explained in our preceding sections.

So let the Heptagon be BCDEFGH, and let all angles be joined with one another, and let A be the center of the circle, and BAP a Diameter, and let A be joined to E.

First of all, such figures do not possess any non intrinsic construction like that mentioned above^^^: for the number of their sides and angles is one of the primes: but no pair of the previous figures divides the complete circle into parts that can be counted by any Prime Number: instead they [the resultant figures] correspond to a Number which is a Multiple of the Numbers [corresponding] to each figure.

But nor do figures of this kind have a proper construction through the number of their angles: because whatever can be extracted from this is vague and non unique and very ill-determined.

For let the Heptagon be divided up into its five triangles, two on the outside being isosceles and Obtuse-angled, namely triangles BDG and BGH, one on the inside being isosceles and Acute-angled, namely BEF, and two Scalene triangles lying in between, namely BED and BFG. So since the [arc of the] circumference on which the sides containing the angles stand, the angles themselves being on the opposite part of the circumference, takes its measure from its angle, [we may note that] the angle BEF stands on three parts [i£. sevenths] of the circumference, BH, HG, GF; the angle BFE similarly [stands] on the three [parts] BG, GD, DE; while EBF is on one [part] EE Therefore BEF is a triangle such
that each of its base angles is equal to three times the angle at its vertex. Simi­
larly we may show that the Scalene triangle BED has angles in continuous
double proportion. 

The simple angle is the one at B, the double at E, and the quadruple at D, being double the angle at E.
Thus if this figure [the heptagon] has a precise {certam) descrip­
tion independent of the circle, as did the pentagon above, it is required
(as has already been pointed out by Campanus, Girolamo Cardano,
and Foix de Candale)'^'^^ that first of all it must be possible to construct
such triangles, as a triangle was constructed for the Pentagon having
each of the angles at its base equal to twice the angle at the vertex.
But for that Pentagon Triangle we obtained from the angles a precise proportion for the sides; in this Heptagon triangle, we have no precise
proportion. For let I, K be the points in which BF is cut by EH, EG
the trisectors of the angle BEE So in triangle FEI, because the angle
FEI is bisected: so in it the ratio of FE to El is equal to the ratio of
FK to KL But EF is equal to the whole of FI. For angle FEI is 4 sevenths
of a right angle, and angle EFI is 6 sevenths, therefore EIF is also 4
sevenths. So the sides (crura) FE, FI opposite the equal angles are equal.
For the same reason El and IB are equal: so the ratio of FI to IB is
equal to the ratio of FK to KI. Further, in triangle KEB, because angle
KEB is bisected by the line EIH: therefore the ratio of KE to EB is
equal to the ratio of KI to IB. But KE and FE are equal, because tri­
angle KEF is isosceles and similar to the triangle EBF; indeed EF was
equal to the line IF, and EB is equal to the line FB; so the ratio of
IF to FB is equal to the ratio of KI to IB. So, for the same line BF, the
chord subtending three sevenths of the circle, we have found two pro­
portionalities, of three parts: first that the ratio of the mean line, KI,
to the least one, KF, is equal to the ratio of the greatest one, IB, to
the line IF, composed [i.e. the sum] of the two smaller ones, that is
to the line FE, the side of the heptagon (septanguli): second that the
ratio of the greatest line, IB, to the mean one, IK, is equal to the ratio
of the whole line, BF, to the line FI, composed [i.e. the sum] of the
two smallest. This kind of proportionality seems to carry the impli­
cation that there is a unique precisely determinate proportion between
the lines EF and FB; and Cardano, who, when he discussed this matter
concerning the sides of the Scalene triangle BED, gave it the name
Reflexive Proportion, boasted, falsely, that he had found the side of
the heptagon (septanguli) F o r no precise quantity follows for either


the line EF or IF; because what we think is new information given
in the second relationship is the same as the information given in
the first. For, whatever 4 proportional quantities-''*-^ are related to one
another in such a way that [the sum of] the first two is equal to the
third; it also holds that the ratio of the first to the third, and of the
second to the fourth, is equal to the ratio of the third to the quantity
composed [i.e. the sum] of the third and the fourth, which composite
quantity becomes a fifth member [of the series set up by the relation­
ships]. So the number of Cases-^”^ is infinite, either in terms of com­
mensurable quantities or in terms of incommensurable ones. And in
fact the number of cases for commensurable terms is the same as that
of superparticular proportions, that is the same as the number of
uneven square Numbers.^"-’
And the same as there are

For the ratio of 15 to 9 is equal to the ratio of 40 to 24, the number
that is the sum of 15 and 9. And the ratio of 40 to 15 is equal to the ratio
of 64 (made up of 40, 15 and 9) to 24, the sum of 15 and 9.



This property is common to many proportional relationships, and
it follows necessarily from the structure of the heptagon but, from
only what has been given, it is not possible to construct the triangle
belonging to the heptagon {triangulum septangulare). The reason why
in the Pentagon the proportion of the side can be precisely determined from the angles, even independently of the circle, while the
same is not true for the Heptagon and other such figures, is easily
seen from what has been said already. In the triangle BFK pertaining
^
to the Pentagon, bisection of the angle BFK
at once gives the isosceles triangles BKT and
KTF, two of its [the pentagon’s] elementary
triangles, and it follows from the equality of
their angles BFK, BKT, that the sides BK, KT,
TF are equal; but in the case of the Heptagon
triangle, trisection of the angle produces three
elementary triangles, two isosceles triangles
BEI, KEF and one scalene triangle, lEK, nor
does it follow from the proportion between
its [the scalene triangle’s] angles that there is any particular propor­
tion between the sides, as is known by Geometry.^'''^ Thus, since the
angles of this figure have no significance independently of the circle;
so the required triangle cannot be constructed independently of the
circle. So this figure cannot be inscribed in a circle, by means of any­
thing prior to itself in regard to knowledge or description, but this
vague proportion is narrowed down into a single result only by some
procedure for inscription and thus we have a circular argument; for
in order to find what is required to carry through the inscription we
are instructed to make use of the inscription procedure itself, as if
it were already possible.^^^
So the ratio between the Side [of the heptagon], EF, and the side
of the star, FB is latent; is latent, I mean, in quantitative matters, so
that by reason of the relevant principle regarding quantities, that is
[the method involving the use of an] indeterminate magnitude,^*


is in fact possible to construct the side of the heptagon in correct pro­
portion to the diameter of the circle: since let there be given a mag­
nitude that is certainly greater than the side of the heptagon, and one
that is certainly less than it, in the same Circle: and further, sub­
division proceeding to infinity can always give magnitudes greater than
the side EF or less than it: but, on account of the formal properties
of quantities, it is simply impossible [to find such a procedure of sub­
division], because the figure of the heptagon, and similar figures, are
completely lacking in any mean quantities which might lead to demon­
strating or finding a proportional relation for the side of the figure
[i.e. its relationship to the diameter of the circle] and thus to construct­
ing it or demonstrating that it is knowable (noscibilis). Since this is so,
it is not possible to inscribe a 14-sided figure in a circle with diameter
AP, the side being EF, nor for two neighboring sides [of such a figure]
to subtend a chord EF, which would be the side of the Heptagon in­
scribed in the circle: nor will it be possible for this side [i.e. of the
14-gon] to be compared with the diameter, since by its Nature its re­
lationship to the Diameter is unknown.
So no Regular Heptagon (Septangulum) has ever been constructed
by anyone knowingly and deliberately, and working as proposed; nor
can it be constructed as proposed; but it can well be constructed for­
tuitously; yet it is, all the same, [logically] necessary that it cannot be
known whether the figure has been constructed or no.
Here it might be suggested that I should use the Analytic art called
Algebra after the Arab Geber, its Italian name being Cossa: for in this
art the sides of all kinds of Polygon seem to be determinable. For
example, for the Heptagon the following procedure is adopted byjost
Biirgi, Instrument maker (Mechanicus) to the Emperor and to the Land­
grave of Hesse^"^; who is noted for his very ingenious and surprising
achievements in this matter.
First he assigns the value 2 to BP, the diameter of the circle, so
that AB shall be a complete unit, which will be divided into parts by
an indefinite [procedure of] subdivision, and these parts will give a
numerical value for the length of the side BC. Then he assumes that
the ratio of AB to BC is known, though this ratio is in fact what we
are required to find. And he sets up the series of ratios so that the
ratio of AB [taken as] 1 to BC [taken as] I!^, is equal to the ratio of
iij to U, and U to
and ic^ to m , and nh to IJ
and so on for
ever, which we shall express in a more convenient notation using
Roman numerals, thus: 1, Ij, lij, liij, liiij, Iv, Ivj, Ivij, and so on having made these assumptions we first consider the quadrilateral BEDC.

So, since it has been proved by Ptolemy, Copernicus, Regiomontanus, Pitiscus,
and others who have written on the theory of sines; that in any cyclic quadri­
lateral the single rectangle contained by the Diagonals, CE, DB, is equal to the
sum of the two rectangles contained by the [pairs of] opposite sides, namely,
that of DC and ED, and that of CB and DE'^^ f- And again since it is known
from Geometry that the sum of the squares of CO, half the chord CH, and OB,
the sagitta,^^^ is equal to the square of the side CB.'^^'^
Therefore let BP be equal to 2 [units] and CB be equal to Ij, so that its
square is lij, divide this by BP, it gives BOf^^^ namely lij divided by 2 [units],
squared [this is] liiij divided by 4, subtract this from the square of CB, lij,
the remainder is 4ij - liiij [all] divided by 4, [which is] the square of CO.
Now since CH is twice the line CO, the square of the line CH is 16ij - 4iiij
[all] divided by 4, that is 4ij - liiij.
Therefore, since we wish to have the square of CH or CB, that is the rec­
tangle contained by BC and CEN'^ multiply CB into DE, so that the rectangle
contained by these lines is lij, subtract this from the rectangle contained by BD, CE, which is 4ij - liiij, there remains the rectangle contained by CD,
BE, which is 3ij - liiij, divide this by Ij, that is by CD, the result will be
BE, 3j - liij.
Further, we turn to the Quadrilateral DBHE. And because BE is 3j - liij,
the rectangle contained by BE, DE, that is the square of the line BE,^^^ will
be 9ij - 6iiij + Ivj: subtract the rectangle contained by BH, DE, [which is]
lij, there will remain the rectangle contained between BD, EH, which is 8ij
- 6iiij + Ivj, divide this by EH, which is 3j - liij, the result will be BD,
8ij - 6iiij + Ivj [all] divided by 3j - liij: its square [Le. BD^] will be 64iiij
- 96vj + 32viij - 12x + Ixij [all] divided by 9ij - 6iiij + Ivj, which
was [earlier found to be] 4ij - liiij: multiply this [value] by the denominator
[of the previous expression] and we have
36iiij - 33vj + lOviij - lx equals 64iiij - 96vj + 52iij - 12x + Ixij
therefore also 63vj + llx equals 28iiij + 42viij + lxij3^^ therefore also
63ij + llvj equals 28 + 42iiij + lviij3^^ This equation gives the quantity
of the side of the Heptagon.
Or we turn, further, to BD, EG. Now the square DC,
gij _
+ Ivj. But the square DB, EG^'^^ is 4ij - liiij, subtract this latter from the
former, the rectangle contained by DE, BG will be 5ij - 5iiij + Ivj, divide
this by DE, that is Ij, BG will be 5j - 5iij + Iv, whose square is 25ij -
50iiij + 35vj - lOviij + lx, which earlier was [found to be] 4ij - liiij. So
49iiij + lOviij equals 2 lij + 33vj + lx
Therefore also 49ij + lOvj equals 21 + 33iiij + Iviij.
This equation too gives the quantity of the Heptagon side: but
Biirgi turns his attention away from the complete circle and considers
it only as an arc that is to be divided into 7 [equal] parts. So since
the chord subtending 2 parts can be found by this algebraic proce­
dure {cossice), he seeks the chord subtending 4 parts, and finds it (by
the same method as above) to be the Root of 16ij - 20iiij + 8 vj -
Iviij. He now makes use of the Diagonal in a new quadrilateral, [two
of] whose sides are chords subtending three sevenths, so that the Rec­
tangle they contain is 9iJ - 6 iiij + Ivj, which, subtracted from the
Rectangle 16ij - 20iiij + 8 vj - Iviij, leaves, as the rectangle of the
remaining [two] sides, 7ij - 14iiij -I- 7vj - Iviij. He makes use of this chord, comparing it either with the number that expresses the chord
subtended by the arc that is to be divided into seven parts, or with
the figure zero, if the whole circle is to be divided into seven, as here:
and then either that number or the figure zero is equal to the quantities
7j -
14iij + 7v -
Ivij or 7 -
14ij + 7iiij -
lvj .^^2
Then he deduces from the equation, which he solves mechani-
cally,223 not one value for the root, but two for the Pentagon, three
for the Heptagon, four for the Nonagon, and so on: for one value is
BC, the second BD and the third B E .224
In order to make it clear that this type of investigation of the sides
of the figure has absolutely nothing in common with the Definitions
we gave above, in our Sections I, II and III: you will note, first, that
one may ask what this algebraic chord of Biirgi’s signifies? It certainly
signifies that if seven lines are constructed in continuous proportion,
the proportion being that between the side of the heptagon and the
semidiameter of the circle, and the first proportional is made equal
to the side of the heptagon: then seven lines equal to the first pro­
portional plus seven equal to the fifth will add up to the same as four­
teen lines equal to the third proportional plus one line equal to the
seventh.
This statement is indeed Geometrical and can be demonstrated,
no less than what went before, when we showed that the surface of
the Octagon was Medial, or the side of the Dodecagon was an Apotome


of some line. For there, something was being stated about the sur­
face or line, here something is stated about the proportion between
lines.
But just as it is not enough for me, for knowing and measuring
a surface, to know that it is a Medial, and not enough for measuring
a line to know that it is an Apotome of some line: since there are many
quantities of such a type, and there is no construction [to be deduced]
from this general remark, and no precise and certain quantity for the
plane or line may be elicited from it, but these properties only follow
from quantities previously constructed and described: so here also,
it is not enough for me to know what would happen once the seven
lines in continuous proportion, according to the proportion that I
require, have been set up: but since I do not yet have that proportion
described by geometrical means: therefore I waited for someone to
explain to me how to set up that proportion first. For thus for all pre­
vious figures the procedure was [in the order]: description, inscrip­
tion in a circle, determination of a precise quantity, and a precise Geo­
metrical means by which this determination might be carried out; finally
there followed the knowledge of the properties which permitted com­
parison of figures one with another.
To make the distinction in this matter clearer, let us look at the
side of the Pentagon, whose mode of description, described above,
was that, having combined two squares, one [whose side was] the semi­
diameter, the other [with side equal to] half of it, to make a square
shape,^^'’ we subtracted from the side of this square half of the semi­
diameter; the square of the line that Remains was combined again
with the square of the semidiameter, and [the result] made into a square
shape, and the side of this square would be the side of the Pentagon.
All this is possible and easier to do than to explain in words, as anyone
knows who is used to handling compasses. For what is easier than to
construct a right angle GAM, and to take on the lines enclosing it
any length AM and double that length AG, and having placed one
point of the compasses in M, and opened the compasses so that the
other reaches to G, draw the circle GP, extend the line MA to P, then
take the length GP with the compasses and transfer it into another
circle^‘^^ whose diameter is GA?
But now see what Biirgi’s Cossa tells us about the side of the
Pentagon. By the Method employed above we obtain the number 5j -
5iiJ + Iv, which is not equal to any chord; that is, if five quantities
are constructed in continuous proportion, the first of them being the
side of the Pentagon; the proportion being that of the side of the
Pentagon to the semidiameter; then five lines equal to the first proportional plus one [equal to the] fifth will be equal to five [equal to
the] third.-^'^’
Again, as for the heptagon, this does not tell us how to construct
the continuous proportion for which this relationship will hold, nor
does it express the lengths of the proportionals in terms of things already
known, but it tells us, once the [system of continuous] proportion is
set out, what relationship will follow. So I am instructed to represent
the relationship {affectio), for it will then come about that I obtained
the proportion also.'^'^^ But how am I to represent the relationship,
by what Geometrical procedure? No other means of doing it are
afforded me save using the proportion I seek; there is a circular argu­
ment: and the unhappy Calculator, robbed of all Geometrical defenses,
held fast in the thorny thicket of Numbers, looks in vain to his algebra
(cossa). This is one distinction between Algebraic (Cossicas) and Geo­
metrical determinations.
Another is that all this reasoning of Biirgi’s depends upon the na­
ture (essentia) of a discrete quantity, namely that of numbers; and it
divides the diameter into precise small parts, as many times and as
far as he wishes, generally into two parts; on which number [sc. of
division] the whole process depends, and it would be changed if the
Diameter were given another value (nomen), or a different number of
parts.*^^^
But Geometry does not deal with figures in this way, as we have
seen above, though it does indeed designate sides Expressible in length
by Numbers; but inexpressible ones it in no way attempts to capture
with numbers, but states their magnitudes according to their partic­
ular kinds, so that it is clear that we are dealing not with discrete quan­
tities but with continuous ones, that is with lines and surfaces.
Third, so far, both the side of the Figure and the side of its related
star, each had a precise description;^-^^' in this Algebraic Analysis, the
most surprising thing is that (although this may especially frighten
the Geometer) there is no one way to produce what we are asked for.
All the same this is not entirely without a pattern of its own, but, as
I started to explain above, the number of numbers making up what
is required is the same as the number of chords or Diagonals of differ­
ent lengths comprised in the figure, so that in the pentagon there are
two, in the heptagon three, one for the side [of the figure], the re  mainder for chords subtending an angle [i.e. diagonals]. So that what­
ever is stated concerning the particular proportion of the figure^-^'
holds for the proportions of all lines to the diameter.^^^
Fourth, assuming that a single proportion would [suffice to] define
what is required; I am not told how to bring the matter to a conclu­
sion but only how to stalk the quarry, from a distance. For since the
kinds of line, according to their [degree of] knowledge, are found among
the Inexpressibles (that is, they are not numerable but reject numbers),
there will accordingly be no multiplicity of numbers that can exhaust
the ratio without leaving some uncertainty in it: on the other hand,
this ratio, as mentioned in our second point above, takes no refuge
except in numbers, but repeatedly divides the diameter in various ways
into many Myriads of Myriads of parts, to make [the numerical ex­
pression for] the ratio more and more exact^^S; but this never gives
a completely exact value; and, in short: this is not to know the thing
itself but only something close to it, either greater or less than it; and
some later calculator (computator) can always get closer to it [still]; but
to none is it ever given to arrive at it exactly. Such indeed are all quan­
tities which are only to be found in the properties of matter of a definite
amount; and they do not have a knowable construction by which in
practice they might be accessible to human knowledge.^^"*
Fifth, let us concern ourselves specifically with the heptagon and
following figures of this type {genus) [ 5 ?c], as they follow one another
in order the [series of lines in] continuous proportion will grow longer
as the number of sides increases: so if the one of most interest were
the last one, as, for the heptagon, the seventh of the proportionals;
it would, all the same, not be possible to use it to find the intermediate
proportionals. For between two [lines], which are not in the propor­
tion of two numbers of the continuous proportion, such as that one
is the cube or the fifth power^^'’ and so on of the other, it is not
C ons t ruct i on
R egular F i gures
73
possible geometrically to set up any number of intermediate magni­
tudes in continuous proportion but only one or three or seven or fifteen,
and so on, while in the plane it is not possible to set up two or four,
five, six, eight, nine, and so on^^®; since here we are considering plane
figures.
Now, between the semidiameter, of magnitude 1, and the seventh
proportional, of magnitude Ivij, in the [system of] proportion relat­
ing to the heptagon, there are six mean proportionals, and the ratio
of 1 to IviJ is not that of a number to a number^^^ in a continuous
[system of] proportion that is equally long; that is to say, the propor­
tion of the semidiameter to the side of the heptagon is not like that
of two numbers, that is, it is not Expressible. For if it were Expressible
it would fall into one of the categories {species) already discussed, [those]
belonging to the earlier classes, and the seven angles would not be
seven but [instead] three or four, which involves a contradiction. For
the proportion of the sides of the first figures {primarum figurarum)
was [deduced] from their angles.^^* Thus it would have been necessary
to construct all six mean proportionals in a single step, that is [the
mean proportionals] between 1 and Ivij. On the other hand, if Ivij
were given in magnitude; then there would be five mean proportion­
als between 1 and Ivj. Therefore, if the ratio of 1 to Ivj were then
to be that of a cubic number to another cubic number, then first it
would be possible to construct lij and liiij in a single step, afterwards,
in three steps, three mean proportionals between 1 , lij, liiij and Ivj.^^^
However, if Iv were given in magnitude, again all four intermediate
magnitudes would have to be constructed in a single step; which can­
not be done, unless the proportion concerned is Expressible, as above.
The other [examples] are all subsumed under these.
So we conclude that these Algebraic (Cossicas) Analyses make no
contribution to our present concerns; nor do they set up any degree
of knowledge that can be compared with what we discussed earlier.
Now it is appropriate to put a word in here for Metaphysicians
in connection with this algebraic treatment: let them consider if they

among unknowable things. And yet this which
is not a knowable entity has some properties which are susceptible
of knowledge; just as if [they were] Entities with characteristics. For
if there were a Heptagon inscribed in a circle, the proportion of its
sides [to the semidiameter] would have such properties. Let this in­
dication suffice.
There are also other untrue propositions put forward by Geome­
ters concerning the sides of figures like this, but which someone relalively experienced in the Mechanical [art] would reject though because
they are Mechanical they are pressed on the young‘^^b as when
Albrecht Diirer puts the side of the Heptagon,
AC, equal to half of AB, the side of the Trigon
drawn in the same circle.^^^ That this is in fact
considerably too short is apparent even from
Mechanics-^^^: however, lest anyone be misled by
a rather crude practical trial; he can recognize
its falsity even by this reasoning alone, without
any manual procedure. From the number of its
angles the side of the Trigon is proved to be
Expressible in square: therefore so is half of it. The side of the Hepta­
gon is not Expressible in square, precisely because it belongs to the
Heptagon: and because seven is not six, nor five, nor three. For prime
numbers give rise to sides of [particular] kinds; but these kinds [of
line] are incommensurable with one another, and no one of them is
the same as another.
For the fallacies put forward by Carolus Marianus of Cremona and
Francois de Foix, Comte de Candale, concerning the Heptagon see
Christopher Clavius, Practical Geometry Book VIII, proposition 30, and
his commentary on Euclid Book IV, proposition 16.^^^
This contest also spurred into action the Most Illustrious Lord
the Marchese de Malaspina, who in 1614 was the Ambassador of the


Most Serene Duke of Parma to the Imperial court; and whose most
ingenious diagram beat all the descriptions put forward by everyone
else; estimating that the chord subtended by three fourteenths of the
circle was equal to five quarters of the semidiameter, and thus express­
ible in length: so expertly was the apparatus of proof deployed that
even Euclid himself might have failed to notice that something had
been assumed without proof.

For the side of the Endecagon the following description is in circu­
lation; In a circle, let there be drawn from the same point A, the side
of a Tetragon AC, in one direction, the side
of a Trigon AD in the opposite one, and the
side of the Hexagon AB, AF in each direc­
tion: and let the angle FAB contained by the
two Hexagon sides subtend another Trigon
side, BF, which will cut the first Trigon side,
AD, in G: let there also be drawn from the
end C of the Tetragon side the diameter CE,
passing through I, the center of the circle,
and from the other end of the diameter, E,
through the point of intersection, G, of the
two Trigon sides, let there be drawn the straight line EG, cutting the
Tetragon side AC in H: the line GH between these two points of inter­
section is said to be the side of the Endecagon. It is indeed too long,
as even practical methods (Mechanica) show. But an expert (sollers) Geo­
meter will bear in mind the kind of line that is involved, which nec­
essarily has something in common with the sides of the Trigon and
the Tetragon, though it belongs to a remote degree. But, all the same, the number 11, being a Prime, does not in any way lead one to these figures, for since it is a Prime it has nothing [sc. no factors] in common
with 3 or 4. So the Geometer is confident that the description [just
given for the Endecagon] is incorrect; and he may easily dispense with
the labor of [checking this by] computation.'^^*’

It remains, therefore, that for all these objections, for all the frustrated attempts by all these scholars, the sides of figures of this kind are by their very Nature unknown and unknowable. 

So it is not to be wondered at that what could not be found in the Archetype of the World is not expressed either in the structure of the parts of that World.
