## Proposition 21


<!-- Sic, Euclid, Elements X, 21 in Heath’s translation (see Euclid trans. Heath, vol.
Ill, p. 49) —and in Caspar’s translation of Harmonice mundi, which has similar silent
“corrections” elsewhere (for this one see Weltharmonik, p. 23).
Most of Kepler’s references to individual propositions of the Elements give them
numbers that correspond to those in Heath’s translation (made from Heiberg’s Greek
text). However, the pattern of agreements and divergences between Kepler’s number­
ing and Heath’s indicates that Kepler is referring to the Greek text of the Elements,
edited by Simon Grynaeus, printed byjohannes Hervagius in Basel in 1533. Grynaeus
based his text on Theon’s recension of the Elements. The volume also included the
Greek text of Proclus’ Commentary on the first book of the Elements.
24 Sic, see previous note. As above, Caspar’s translation again contains a silent
“correction.” Euclid, Elements X, 25 and 27 in Heath’s translation; see Euclid trans.

It is required to know that from two lines commensurable with one
another in length nothing can be made which should be taken into
account here, whether the lines are Expressible, or Medial, or of lower
standing.29

For if they are commensurable in length, the whole built up from them will
be commensurable with the parts. Now a line commensurable with an Expres­
sible line is Expressible: by the definitions before Euclid X,20.'^^ And a line com­
mensurable with a Medial line is a Medial by 24 of the same.'^^ And a line
commensurable with any of the Inexpressible lines that follow the Medials is
of the same kind as it is, by 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107 [of Euclid
And so it is also with the other further kinds of line, not
mentioned by Euclid, which make more remote degrees [of knowledge].
And even if it were not so for them, it does not matter to us. For they
either come down to one of the kinds [of line] which we shall now
constitute from incommensurable lines; and thus do not increase the
number [of degrees]: or they make lower kinds of their own or an­
other type; and thus they do not belong at this point, where we are
setting out the degrees which are closest in rank to those already
described.



## Part 22 Lines commensurable in Area

<!-- So, having dealt with  length, let us go on to those which are commensurable only in square.  -->

If 2 such Expressible lines are combined, they form a Binomial. 

If they are subtracted, the remainder is an Apotome. This has 6 subordinate kinds of each as stated by Propositions 48 and 85 of Book 10 of Euclid.

If we combine 2 such Medials, which either form an Expressible Rectangle or a Medial one, they will make by addition "Bimedials"

By subtraction Medial Apotomes, the former takes their name from the Binomials, the latter from the Apotomes.

Here we may not join up an Expressible line with a Medial one: for two such lines are simply incommensurable, a type that will be discussed in the following section.


## Proposition 23: No pair of incommensurable lines can produce the required resultants

<!-- There remain the lines completely  with one another. -->

This is because they are both Medial or one is Medial and the other Expressible.

In the one case because the pair is of low standing, in the other because the natures of the two lines of the pair are different. See Euclid X, 71, 108, 109.

So no kind of combination can be called in here: we are left only with the lines of lower standing, having excluded the Expressible and the Medial.


## Proposition 24: An Expressible line emerges when the first pair of such completely incommensurable lines are added or subtracted

These lines are those described in Part 17 as fifth degree knowable.


They are necessarily Binomial and Apotome, see Euclid X, 112, 113, 114. 

As when both the sum of the squares of a Binomial and of an Apotome, and their Rectangle, is Expressible, it is necessary that the individual Terms of the one should be commensurable with the individual Terms of the other, which is not the case for all Binomials and Apotomes. 

Because two such lines which have the two required resultants necessarily form a Binomial and an Apotome; this is proved in the same way as [Euclid] X, 33, except that for two pijrai<; Suvapsi povov [lines expressible only in the power] we use pqxai pqKEi [lines expressible in length] and for the word psaov [medial] we substitute pqxov [expressible]: and finally we use the definition of the Binomial and the Apotome.

By the addition and subtraction of a Binomial and an Apotome, with the required resultants, we get back to an Expressible line is seen as follows. 

For when the sum of the squares is Expressible, and the Rectangle is Expressible; adding the lines together, the square [of the sum] will be composed of the square of each line, and twice the rectangle of the lines, that is, it is composed of two parts which are Expressible: so the whole square will be Expressible: thus so too will be the composite line, whose power is equal to the square. 

Let:
- the Binomial be `Xp`, its square ko
- the apotome be `XO`, its square 6 k 
- `6 k` and `ko` be taken together be Expressible
- the Rectangle made of `OX`, `Xp` also be expressible

Two such rectangles `Kp`, `k ^` complete the whole square of the composite line `Op`, which square is `0o`.

For subtraction the proof is as follows. 

If the line composed of `OX`, `pX`, that is `Op`, is expressible, half of it. On, will also be Expressible (as the larger term) and `nX` the smaller term, and the other half [of Ofj., namely] nii; take from it na equal to the line dX, and the remainder will also be Expressible, and also the complete line `Xo`, that is double the line na. 

But Xo is the remainder after subtracting the Apotome fio from the Binomial Xfx. Thus the remainder is Expressible.


## Part 25: The 12 kinds of Euclidiean Quantities 

From the second pair of the sixth degree*, let us:
- add them to get a Mizon also called a Major
- subtract them to get an Elasson or Minor

> *Part 18, consisting of lines completely incommensurable with one another the sum of whose squares is Expressible, while their Rectangle is Medial


From the third pair*, let us:
- add them to get the side of a square that is Expressible and Medial
- subtract them to make a Complete Medial with an Expressible

> *where the sum of the squares is Medial and the Rectangle is Expressible


From a fourth pair of the seventh degree*, let us:
- add them to get the side of a square that is Bimedial
- subtract them [a quantity which is said] to Make with a Medial a Complete Medial.

> *Section 19 where each resultant^' is a Medial


Here is the Origin of the 12 kinds of quantities treated by Euclid and the explanation for their Number.

Euclid did not consider that he needed to go on to consider more remote kinds [of quantities] which as the sum of their squares, or as their common Rectangle, or both, go beyond the Expressible or the Medial to produce still lower kinds of quantity.
