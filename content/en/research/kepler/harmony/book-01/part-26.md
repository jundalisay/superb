XVI Definition and Comparison
These [areas] might suffice us for establishing the degrees of construc­
tions by which the sides of the figures which we need for the study
of Harmony are distinguished, if there were not other properties as
well as those mentioned, or rather if the properties so far mentioned
were not preceded by others that are nobler by which the degrees of
knowable constructions are multiplied.
We have come to addition and subtraction; where we have chosen
freely the lines that are to be added or subtracted, not imposing any
definite quantity upon them. So if we now introduce rules, imposing
a definite proportion upon pairs [of lines], not given in such a way
that when they were combined they formed one of the twelve kinds
[of line already discussed]; but the pairs given in some other way, namely
when it is required for one given line also to find its greater part so
that the ratio of the smaller to the greater part will be equal to the
ratio of the greater part to the sum of them both; or alternatively the
ratio of the greater to the smaller will be equal to the ratio of the
smaller to the remainder. When the two are subtracted, the result will
not always be [a line belonging to] some more remote degree [of com-
mensurability], but in the circumstances, we shall fall back on one
of the kinds that have been discussed, and having fallen back on it,
we shall compare the line that is found, which of itself is of the eighth
degree,^"* with lines of the fourth degree.
For in this way two lines of the fourth degree (as defined in section
XV) together formed an area, from which, when it is cast into the form
of a square, there emerged [as the side of the square] a line called
a Medial: so the two lines, the Whole and one part, form, by subtrac­
tion, the other part, or the two parts, by addition, form the whole.
In the former case, the constituent lines were commensurable with
one another only in square: in the latter, in place of commensurability,
we have identity of proportion between whole and parts. In the former
case the similarity of proportion was between the smaller [part] and
the line to be formed [i.e. the difference], and between the line to be
formed and the greater [part]; in the latter case there is also a simi­
larity of proportion between the two lines to be formed, and between
one of them and the proposed whole line [i.e. the sum], for subtrac­
tion, while for addition [the proportion is] between one of the lines
to be formed, and the proposed line, and the other line to be formed.
So, in the former case, given two [lines], a Rectangle was given equal
to the square of the line that was to be formed, and thus the area [entered
into the question] before the line [i.e. the side of the square]: in the latter case, on the contrary, having made the two [lines] that were to
be made, there then follows the equality between the Rectangle of the
extreme [lines] and the square of the Mean one, by Euclid VI.17 and
11.11.4'^
In the former case the straight lines that make the area had squares
commensurable with the square of the proposed Line: in the latter,
from Euclid VL30 we know that we must take a square, commensu­
rable with the square of the proposed line, nam ely! times it, and from
the side of this square we must subtract half the proposed line, so
that there remains the required part of the proposed line; and when
this part is subtracted from the proposed line there is left the other
required part, (or if it is added to the whole we obtain the third re­
quired line)."^® And parts that have so many terms should, it seems,
be placed in the fourth degree.

For at this point we obtain aline of higher standing than the Medial
itself, whichever line it is that the proportion is found iiU': because
the Medial hangs from the proposed Expressible line by a longer chain
[of terms] made up of four links: whereas the parts of this [line] depend
upon the ratio in which they stand directly to the proposed Expres­
sible line. From this it comes about that there can be many Medials
all the same degree away from the Expressible line; indeed the larger
part is the one and only part of an expressible line which is in this
proportion, and in all cases of any line of lower standing than the
Expressible^*^ there is one unique part in such proportion. Because
of this^^ its construction is equivalent in a sense to the first degree.
Thus when the proposed Straight Line is required to be the whole,
and we seek its two parts according to this proportion {tales), then
Geometers call this division in Extreme and Mean ratio. Certainly
this name means that whereas at other times ordinary division of the
whole into two parts is not concerned with proportion, or if some line
[is constructed] that bears to the whole the ratio of the smaller part
to the greater, then there will result four terms, two extremes and two
Means: in this case, on the contrary, there are only three terms, the
whole and the smaller part being the two extremes; and the greater
part being the unique mean term.’’*’
It is also, for the same reason, called proportional section.*’’ Today
both the section, and the proportion it defines, are given the title
“Divine,” because of the marvelous nature of the section and its multi­
plicity of interesting properties: the foremost of which is that always
when the greater part is added to the whole the compound line is
again divided in the same way and the part which was the greater part
now becomes the smaller part of the compound line; and the erst­
while whole line becomes the greater part of the compound line, by
Euclid XIII.5.52


XXVII Proposition
While such a division can be performed on all lines, on a line Ex­
pressible in length, on one Expressible only in square, on a Medial
line, on a line of one of the twelve kinds we have listed, and on all
other kinds of line: in the present work we are concerned only with
two of these kinds [of line] which coincide with kinds already explained;
according to the two lines which are to be sectioned [in this way]. For
it [the line to be sectioned] is either Expressible in length or is a Mizon.
If the line which we propose to section is Expressible in length; the
greater part of the sectioned line will be an Apotome of the fourth
kind; and corresponding to it there will be a Binomial of the same
fourth kind, having the same terms as it has.^‘^ But beware of con­
fusion, for this part is called greater in relation to the proposed line;
but the same part is here called an Apotome, not in relation to the
proposed line; but qualitatively. If you want to know what it is an
apotome of, the answer is that it is an apotome of some line which
is commensurable with the proposed line only in square, which namely
is the side of a square I times that of the proposed line.^'*
Let GA be the line which is to be divided, and let it be Expressible in length.
Construct a right angle GAM and let AM be
half the length of GA, and, having joined the
points G and M, taking center M and radius
GM let there be drawn the semicircular arc PGX,
and let AM be produced to cut this arc at P and
X, and let there be constructed on the line PA
the square PO. Therefore the line GA is divided
in proportional section at the point O. So the line AO is the greater part of
the line GA that has been divided in proportional section; but the same line
AO or the line AP, which is equal to it, is an Apotome not of the line GA but
of the line MP or MG, which when square is equal to the sum of the square
of GA and of AM, half of GA: so if the square of the line GA were 4 the square
of AM would be 1. Thus the square of the line GM would be 5. Insofar as AO
or AP is an Apotome it corresponds to the binomial AX: and their common
terms are MX, or MP, or MG, and AM.^^
Now the fact that AP is an Apotome, and AX a Binomial, each of the fourth
kind, is proved as follows. For both the terms MX and MA are expressible; however, they are commensurable only in square, because MX (that is MG) is the
side of a square of area 5 units, [the units being] such that MA is the side
of a unit square. And the ratio of 1 to 5 is not that of one square number to
another. Then the difference of the square 1 and 5 is 4, a square number whose
side, 2, is Expressible in length, and is equal to the proposed line GA. These
are the marks of the terms of Binomials of the fourth kind, in the definitions
preceding proposition 48, and of Apotomes, in the definitions preceding prop­
osition 85 of Euclid
Lastly if the Expressible line GA is divided in proportional section, its greater
part, OA, and the line compounded from OA and AG^"^ are both of the fifth
degree of knowledge. For if their squares are combined their sum is Expressible,
namely three times that of the square of the expressible line GA by Euclid
XIII.4.^^ Indeed their Rectangle is also Expressible, because it is equal to the
expressible square of the line GA, since GA is a mean proportional between
the part OA and the compound of OA and AG, as was assumed.
