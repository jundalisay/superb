XXXVII Proposition

The sixteen-sided figure (hekkaedecagon) has a Geometrical description from its angles, but knowledge of the side takes us far afield into degrees lower than all the preceding ones: and even more so for the sides of its stars, whether they subtend three, five, or seven sixteenths [of the circle].

Because two eights are sixteen, this figure [the 16-sided polygon] can be described by working via
the side of the Octagon and thus using the same principles that were employed before in deriving the side
of the Octagon via the side of the Tetragon.

Let QO be the side not, as before, of the Tetragon, but of the Octagon and QT, TO now the sides
of the sixteen-angle, and let QP be the side of the star Octagon^‘^‘*: before, the first [i.e. QO] was a
Mizon: therefore LM, which is half of it, was a Mizon.


So the rectangle contained by ST, which is Expressible, and LM, which is Mizon, is of a completely new kind, not mentioned among the degrees discussed above, which were of higher kinds. 

A new area of this kind, subtracted from that contained by the lines LT, TS, which are Expressible in length, again leaves something of a more distant kind, namely the rectangle contained by MT,
TS which is equal to the square of TQ the side of the 16-sided polygon (Hek­
kaedecagon). This holds even more for the figures of this Class with more angles,
such as 32, 64, 128, and so on. 

Since this holds for one side, the chord subtended by one sixteenth
[of the circle], its square, subtracted from that of the diameter of the
circle, leaves [the square of] the chord subtended by seven sixteenths
[of the circle], so the latter is of more distant degree.
Now the chord subtended by three sixteenths [of the circle] is de­
rived from that subtended by three eighths by bisection so the former
is of a more distant degree [i.e. lower degree] than the latter. And the
square of the chord subtended by three sixteenths, subtracted from
the square of the diameter, leaves the square of the chord subtended
by five sixteenths. So this again is of a more distant [i.e. lower]
degree.
XXXVIII Proposition
The sides of the Trigon and the Hexagon have a geometrical descrip­
tion, from the angles of the figures; and when they are described in
a circle, they are knowable, the former in the third, the latter in the
second degree; the surfaces or areas of the figures are Medials, and
are in the ratio T 2 .
The construction of a Trigon independent of the circle is very easy, by Euclid
127 Yhe most expeditious way of inscribing it in a circle (and I pass over
other methods in silence) is to use the side of the Hexagon. Because half of six
is three. And the description and inscription of the Hexagon are given in Euclid
IV.13.^^^ But it remains to show how the magnitude of the side follows, from
the properties (rationibus) of the angles.
Let the Hexagon be BHCGDE So since there are 6 angles, the surface of
the Hexagon will be divided into six triangles, with their vertices meeting at the center A: one of which [triangles] is CAG. Since there are four Right angles
surrounding the center A, their sum, divided among the six vertices, gives for
the single vertical angle CAG [the value] four sixths
or two thirds of a Right angle. But all three angles of
triangle CAG add up to two right angles, or six thirds
of a Right angle; so subtracting the angle at A, 2 thirds,
from the sum of 6 thirds, there remain, for the two angles
at C and G, the sum of 4 thirds: now, all the angles
are equal; so for each of the angles at C and at G there
remain 2 thirds of a Right angle, no less than for the
vertical angle at A. But if the three angles are equal,
the three sides of the Triangle must be equal also. So
CG, which is at the same time the side of the Hexagon and of the triangle that
IS one sixth of it, is equal to the semidiameter of the circle, CA or AG. Thus
the side of the Hexagon is expressible in length, namely half the diameter [of
the circle]. So the former belongs to Degree II by XIII of this book.
Let us consider a triangle [inscribed in the circle] such as triangle BCD.
Its side BC links two sides of the hexagon CH, HB, which meet at H. Thus
since BHC is two thirds of the semicircle and CG one third, therefore the arc
BCG is a semicircle, and BG a diameter, passing through A. Therefore the angle
BCG, the angle in it [sc. the semicircle[ is a Right angle, by Euclid III.31.^‘^^
So [the sum of] the squares of BC and CG is equal to the square of BG, by Euclid
1.47.^'''^ But CG is a semidiameter, and its square is a quarter of that of the
diameter; so subtracting a quarter from the square of the diameter BG gives
as remainder the square of the side of the triangle BC. So this square is Expressible:
but because its ratio to the square of BG is not equal to that of a square number
to a square number, but is as 3 to 4, therefore BC is expressible only in square.
It therefore belongs to the Third degree, by section XIV above.
And because BC, BD are equal, and the angles BCD, BDC are equal; there­
fore BE, the perpendicular dropped [from B] to CD, will cut it in E into equal
lines CE, ED. The complete line CD was Expressible only in square; so the same
is true of half of it, CE. Therefore the rectangle contained by CE, AG, lines com­
mensurable only in square, the latter being Expressible in length, is a Medial.
But this Rectangle is equal to the [sum of the] areas of two triangles, each equal
to the triangle CGA (one of the six triangles that make up the Hexagon), and is thus one third of the Area of the Hexagon. So the area of the Hexagon
is a Medial surface. And because the triangles BCA and BCH have sides BA
and BH, CA and CH equal, and one common side BC: they therefore have equal
areas.^'^'^ But BCH, BDF, CDG are parts of the Hexagonal area, [the parts[ by
which it exceeds the Triangular area BCD, which is equal to the sum of the
triangles BAC, CAD, DAB. Therefore the Hexagonal area is twice the Trian­
gular area. Thus the Triangular area is also Medial, because it is commensurable
with, that is twice, the Hexagonal [area], which was Medial.


XXXIX Proposition

The sides of the Dodecagon and of the star of the same name, namely
the chords subtended by five twelfths of the circle, can be described
Geometrically, and when they are inscribed in the same circle they
[sc. the sides] are individually knowable in the eighth degree of nobility
of knowledge (nobilioris cognitionis), taken together [they are knowable] in
the fifth degree; in fact the surface of the Dodecagon is Expressible.*^^
Let the dodecagon be BMHLCKGQDPFN and the star Dodecagon
BKFLDMGNCPHQB.

So, because twice six are twelve, these figures can be described by working
via the side of the Hexagon, using the same principles as were employed before
in deriving the side of the Octagon via the side of the Tetragon,^^'^ [namely by]
drawing from A, the center of the circle, a line perpendicular to HC, the side
of the hexagon, to cut the side in O and the circle in L and P, and joining the
points L, Hfor the side of the Dodecagon, and the points H, Pfor the side of the star.
So since HC, the side of the hexagon (sexanguli) is Expressible in length;
so too will be its half HO, but AC, equul to HC itself, is, when squared, equal
to the square of its half OC plus the square of AO,^^^ therefore the ratio of the suare of AO to the square of AC or AP is that of 3 to 4, not the ratio of a
square number to a square numberA^^ Therefore PA, AO are commensurable
with one another only in square, as are LA
and AO. And CA, that is PA or AL, the greater,
which is Expressible is, in square, greater than
the square of the smaller, AO, by [the square
of] a magnitude which is commensurable with
CO itself Therefore, by the definitions before
Euclid
the compound line PO is a
Binomial, and by the definition before [Euclid
X.]83,^^^ the remainder OL is an Apotome,
each designated FirsO^^ The Terms are AP,
Expressible in length, and AO, Expressible only
in square. But, by Euclid X.54,^"^^ LLP, in
square equal to the rectangle contained by OP,
a first Binomial, and PL, which is Expressible, is a Binomial, and by 91 of
the same,^"^^ the side of the Dodecagon, in square equal to the rectangle contained
by OL, a first Apotome and LP, which is expressible, is an Apotome. Thus they
[the sides] belong in the eighth degree of nobility of knowledge.^^^^
The Terms of this compound line PH, and of the diminished line HL, are
PS and
And since HB is the side of the Hexagon (sexangulij, KP of
the Triangle, [and] BP of the tetragon fquadranguli), the square of the first
is equal to twice the square of the smaller Term, that is it is equal to the square
of HS plus [that of] SB, the square of the second is equal to twice the square
of the greater [Term], that is it is equal to the square of KS plus [that of] SP;

while the square of the last is equal to the sum of the square of both [Terms],
each taken once, that is [the squares] of BS and SP.^^"^
PH is also a binomial composed of PR, the side of the square, and RH,
the side of the Dodecagon; but it is not called a Binomial on account of this
composition; because, by Euclid
there is only one point, here the point
S, which can divide it into its Terms.
And since HO, LP are Expressible in length, the rectangle they contain,
that is the rectangle contained by LH, HP will be Expressible,and the sum
of the squares of LH and HP is similarly Expressible, being indeed equal to
the square of LP itself.
Therefore on this basis LH and HP taken together
are in the fifth degree of knowledge. Neither do they produce anything new^'^^
when they are combined, nor do they produce a Binomial or an Apotome again;
for adding LH and HP gives a line Expressible only in square, that is the line
whose square is three halves of the square of LP: while subtracting LH, or HR,
from HP again produces a line Expressible in square, [namely] PR, the side
of a square, whose square is half the square of LP.'

And since the Area of the Dodecagon is made up of 12 Triangles, one of
which is LAC, four of these [the triangles] might be contained in the Expressible
rectangle LHPD, that is [it has] a Third of the total Area,^^''^ therefore the total
Area is also Expressible, namely of quantity equal to three times the product
of HO and LP; so the Area is Three Quarters of the square of the diameter,
or the Arithmetic Mean between the Tetragon circumscribing the circle and
the Tetragon inscribed in the circle; just as the Area of the Octagon (Octanguli)
is the Geometric Mean between them.


## 40. Proposition

The Regular figure with twenty-four sides, and all figures obtainable from it by repeated doubling of the number of sides, can be inscribed [in the circle] Geometrically, but the knowledge of the side strays further into degrees still more distant from those considered earlier: and the same applies to the sides of its stars, which subtend 5, 7, or 1 1 twenty-fourths [of the circle].

This is proved as Proposition XXXVII above was from the sixteen-sided figure; but with this difference, that here the side of the star Dodecagon and half of it are first Binomials, so that the rectangle contained by the half [side]
and the diameter, [the latter] being Expressible, this time does not yet come to
be of a new species, because by 54, the side of the area is again a BinomiaV-^-
But now this rectangle, subtracted from the Expressible [rectangle contained
by] the complete [diameter] and the half Diameter, leaves a new species, of which
no mention has so far been made, and of lower degree, because more composite;
and this is produced by the square of the side of the figure with 24 angles.
This is all the more true for figures of this Class with more angles; such
as figures with 48 angles, 96 angles and so on.

The chord subtended by five twenty-fourths of the circle is disclosed by bisection of the arc
containing five twelfths: the square of the former
[i.e. ii] subtracted from the square of the diam­
eter, leaves the square of the chord subtended by
seven twenty-fourths^'-''^: so the square of the side,
or the chord subtended by one twenty-fourth, in
the same way forms the square of the chord sub­
tended by eleven such parts.^'^^ So they all belong
to a more distant degree.

## 41 Proposition

The side of the Decagon and that of the star decagon, or the chord subtended by three tenths of the circle,*^ have a Geometrical description through their angles, and can be inscribed in the circle; and they
are knowable, separately as individuals indeed in the eighth Degree of knowledge, while combined [they are of] the fifth degree; and combined with the semidiameter they are of the fourth degree.


Let the Decagon be BCDEFGHIKL, and its star BEHLDGKCFIB. Therefore, since there are ten angles, the surface of the figure will be composed of
ten triangles meeting at the center A, one of which [triangles] is FAG. So di­
viding up the sum of four right angles, which surrounds the point A, into the ten vertical angles of these triangles, each one comes to 4 tenths or 2 fifths of one
right angle. But the sum of the three angles of this triangle is 10 fifths, that
is 2 Right angles; therefore taking from this the vertical angle at A of two fifths,
the remainder left for the two base angles
is 8fifths: and since they [the base angles]
are equal, each of them is of [size] 4 fifths.
Thus each of the base angles is twice the
angle at the vertex. The proof thatfollows
hangs on this [result].
For if the angle AFG is divided into
two equal parts by the line FO, using
Euclid 1.9^^^; the angles AFO, OFG will
be equal to one another, and each will
be 2 fifths of the Right angle; thus each
will be equal to the angle FAO. So by
Euclid VI.3,^^^ the ratio of A F to FG
will be equal to the ratio of AO to OG.
Now because [angle] OFG is 2 fifths [of a right angle], and the angle OGF
(namely AGF) was 4 fifths, therefore [angle] FOG will also be 4 fifths. So the
angles at O and G being equal, the sides opposite them, FG, FO will also be equal.
In the same way, in the triangle AOF also, since [angle] AFO is 2 fifths
[of a right angle], as was angle FAO; therefore AO and FO (that is the side
[of the decagon] FG) will be equal to one another. Now, the ratio of A F to FG
is equal to the ratio of AO to OG, as already proved; therefore, also, the ratio
of AG to its part, AO, is equal to the ratio of the latter to the remainder, OG.
Thus the Leg^^^ AG is divided proportionately in the point
So, by Euclid
X///.5,*®" if OA or OF, is produced to
so that 01 is equal to the whole line
AG, FI is also divided proportionately at O, and if the points A and I are joined,
AIO will be a triangle congruent (congruum) with the initial triangle FAG,
so that [the angle] OAI will be twice [the angle] FAO, and [angle] FAI will be
6 fifths [of a right angle]. Accordingly, if with center A, and compass opening
AG, the circle FGI is drawn, FG will be the side of the decagon, the greater
part ]produced when] the semidiameter is divided proportionately, and FI the
side of the star, or the chord subtended by three tenths [of the circle], is the line
composed of ]i.e. the sum of] FO and 01, [that is] the side of the decagon and
the semidiameter.
On account of this, these sides, taken together with the semidiameter, can
be accepted as belonging to the fourth degree, by XXVI above.
And since the line that is divided [in proportional section], AG, is Expressible in length, and the side of the decagon is the larger part [produced by the
division]; and the side of the star is composed of [i.e. the sum of] the whole [line
AG] and its greater part; accordingly, by XXVII above, the former [the side of
the decagon] is an Apotome and the latter [the side of the star] is a Binomial,
each of the fourth kind}^^ in this respect they belong to the eighth degree of
knowledge, closely following the side of the Dodecagon and its star, and exactly
on a level with the side of the Octagon and its star.
And by XXIIX above,^'°^^ the remainder OG also, and also half of it, NG,
is an Apotome of the first kind. But beware of supposing that AG is its greater
term and AN its smaller one.
Finally, by the same XXVII above, the sides GF, or OF, and FI combined
not with the semidiameter but with each other belong to the fifth degree of knowl­
edge, because both the sum of their squares and their common Rectangle are
Expressible.
So adding together the side of the Decagon and the side of its star gives
a line expressible only in square, its square being equal to five fourths of the
square of the semidiameter, which [i.e. this line] in the earlier figures from Prop.
XXVII is [shown as] PX, composed of PA (equal to the line OA) and AX: be­
tween which there is the mean proportional GA which is expressible.^^'^
On the other hand, subtracting the side of the Decagon, OF, from the side
of the star, FI, leaves the Expressible line 01, that is the semidiameter.^^^ So
this gives nothing new.
