XLV Proposition

(so-called), and their stars, and the complete classes [of figures] de­
rived from them, have no Geometrical description independent of
the circle: in the circle, although the quantity of the side is deter­
minate, it is equally impossible to evaluate.’^®
This is a matter of importance, for it is on ac­
count of this result that the Heptagon and other
figures of this kind were not employed by God in
ordering the structure of the World, as He did em­

ing sections.
So let the Heptagon be BCDEFGH, and let all
angles be joined with one another, and let A be the

A be joined to E.
First of all, such figures do not possess any non
