XXI Proposition
The plane cannot be filled by a congruence of the individual angles
of plane figures of four or more kinds.
For thefour smallest angles are those of the trigon, the tetragon, the pentagon,
and the hexagon. And the first and last of these add up to two right angles,
while the second of them is a right angle and the third is greater than a right
angle, by one fifth of a right angle. Therefore, if they are joined up they come
to more than four right angles. So by XVI they do not form a congruence. We
should exceed four right angles by even more if larger angles were taken.
XXII Axiom
If two plane angles do not add up to more than a third one, they will
not form a solid angle with it.
XXIII Proposition
Two plane angles of a figure with an odd number of sides will not
come together with an angle of another kind to form a regular solid.
For by XVII the solid angles would not all be the same, which is not in
accordance with definitions V to X.
XXIV Proposition
Three plane angles of figures of three different kinds, one kind having
an odd number of sides, cannot come together in a perfect solid figure.
For, again by XVII, the solid angles would not all be the same, which is
not in accordance with the definitions.
XXV Proposition
The most perfect regular congruences of plane figures to form a solid
figure are five in number. 

This is a scholium to the last proposition of the last book of Euclid.^^ By
XV of the present work we must start with three plane angles, and by XVI
we must finish at six trigon angles, at four tetragon angles and at three hexagon
angles, since, by XVIII, they add up to four right angles.
Now three trigons, fitted together at one angle, make up less than four right
angles in the plane, in fact they make up only two. When we make a solid angle
by putting three trigons together the gap which remains can be filled by a fourth
trigon. This gives the Tetrahedron or Pyramid.^^
Four trigons, fitted together at one angle, make up eight thirds of a right
angle, which is less than twelve thirds, or four right angles. Joining together
the sides of the trigons we obtain a pyramid with an open four-sided base. Two
such pyramids may be fitted together base to base to form a figure closed on
all sides. This gives the Octahedron.
Five trigons, fitted together at one angle, make up ten thirds of a right angle,
which is less than twelve thirds. Joining the sides together two by two round
the common angle we obtain a pyramid with a five-sided base. Each of the angles
around the base must eventually be made up of five plane angles, so each re­
quires another three angles in addition to the two it already has. Thus the ten
plane angles around the base require another fifteen, and fifteen angles will
then point outwards in the opposite direction which adds up to thirty plane
angles, that is the angles of ten trigons. These ten trigons make up a central
zone or column, with a five-sided open end at top and bottom. Another penta­
hedral pyramid fits onto the open base, thus closing the figure all round. This
gives the Icosahedron.
We have now dealt with all cases involving only trigons.
Three tetragon angles are three right angles, less than four right angles
in the plane. Therefore they can be fitted together to form a solid angle. And
when the tetragons are fitted together, they leave three gaps, and three angles
of the plane stick out. So three more tetragons, fitted together to form a solid
angle, will fit together with the first three, their points filling the gaps in the
others and their gaps taking the points of the others. This gives the Hexahedron
or Cube.
Four tetragon angles are four right angles, therefore by XVI they do not
form a solid angle. So we have dealt with all cases forming only tetragons.
Three pentagon angles are eighteen fifths of a plane right angle, which is
less than twenty fifths, or four right angles. Therefore they can be fitted together
to form a solid angle. If we take one pentagon as a base and fit five others round
it in this manner, we obtain a figure with gaps which are five pentagon angles
and points which stick out which are also five plane pentagon angles. We can
then construct another similar figure, in reverse, so that the five plane angles
sticking out of the second figure will fit into the five gaps of the first one, and vice versa. This produces the Dodecahedron. So we have dealt with all cases
involving only pentagons, and thus with all those in which only one kind of
figure is used: since, by XVI, three hexagons do not form a solid angle.
These are the five bodies which the Pythagoreans and Plato, and
Proclus, the commentator on
Euclid, were accustomed to call
the world figures, but, as I said
in the introduction to Book I, it
is not certain how they related
these figures to the bodies of the
world. The general persuasion,
taken from Aristotle, is that since
there were five such figures the
philosophers related them to the
five simple World Bodies, that is
the elements: Fire, Air, Earth, and
Water, and the Fifth Essence, or
celestial matter, the characteris­
tics of the figures being com­
pared with the properties of the
simple bodies. That the cube
stands upright on a square base
expresses stability, which is char­
acteristic of terrestrial matter,
whose weight tends down to the
lowest point, while, as is common­
ly believed,24 the whole globe
of Earth is at rest at the center of
the World. The octahedron, on the other hand, is viewed most ap­
propriately suspended by opposite angles, as in a lathe, the square
which lies exactly midway between these angles dividing the figure
into two equal parts, just as a globe suspended by its poles is divided
by a great circle. This is an image of mobility, as air is the most mobile
of the elements, in speed and direction.
The tetrahedron’s small number of faces is seen as signifying the
dryness of fire, since dry things, by definition, keep within their own
boundaries. The large number of faces of the icosahedron, on the
other hand, is seen as signifying the wetness of water, since wetness,
by definition, is held within the boundaries of other things. For a small
number of faces indicates that a large number from another body will
be associated with them. Furthermore, the plane trigon is proper to

the tetrahedron, since the complete tetrahedral figure is a solid trigon,
while the same trigon is not proper to the icosahedron, but, rather,
incidental to it, since the solid shape of the icosahedron is like a
pentagon, not a trigon. Again, the tetrahedron’s point, rising from one
face, is seen as expressive of the penetrating and dividing power of
fire, while the blunt quinquelinear angle of the icosahedron expresses
the filling power of humours, that is their power to wet. The small
thin tetrahedron shows the nature of fire; the large rounded mass of
the icosahedron shows the nature of water, and as it were the shape
of a drop. The tetrahedron has a very large surface and a very small
body; the icosahedron has a bodily mass much greater than its sur­
face: just as in fire it is the form that predominates and in water it
is the matter.
The dodecahedron is left for the celestial body, having the same
number of faces as the Zodiac has signs. It can be shown that it has
•

the greatest volume of all the figures, just as the heavens enclose every­
thing else.
Although this analogy is acceptable, though not to Aristotle (who
did not believe that the World had been created and thus could not
recognize the power of these quantitative figures as archetypes, be­
cause without an architect there is no such power in them to make
anything corporeal), yet it is acceptable to me and to all Christians,
since our Faith holds that the World, which had no previous existence,
was created by God in weight, measure, and number, that is in accor­
dance with ideas coeternal with Him; although, I say, this sort of anal­
ogy is acceptable, yet framed in this manner it has no force of neces­
sity; indeed, it admits of other interpretations, not only because certain
properties are at variance within the analogy, but also because the
dodecahedron and icosahedron correspond more closely with fire,
and finally because the number of the elements and whether the Earth
is at rest are matters much more open to dispute than is the number
of the figures.
If the Pythagoreans held out against this theory, I do not blame
Ramus, or Aristotle, for rejecting this disputed analogy. Twenty-four
years ago I found out a very different relation between these five figures
and the fabric of the world. I said in the introduction to Book I that
I thought it likely that some of the ancients had been of this same
opinion also, but had kept it secret, in the manner of their sect. For
Copernican Astronomy, or the Astronomy of the ancient Pythagorean
Aristarchus of Samos, describes the moving world as containing six
spheres or paths surrounding the motionless body of the Sun, which
is in the center, the spheres being separated from one another by large
and unequal intervals. The outermost sphere is that of Saturn, the
next that of Jupiter, then that of Mars, then that of the Earth and the
Moon, then that of Venus and lastly that of Mercury, the innermost.
Now we know that it is a fundamental property of these five figures
that they can be inscribed within a spherical surface so that their angles are on the surface, and can also be circumscribed about a spherical
surface so as to touch it at the centers of their faces; moreover, for
any particular figure there is a particular interval between the two
spheres defined in this way. Nothing seems more likely than that the
five intervals between the six celestial spheres were taken by the Creator
from the five figures, in an order such that the cube is to be imagined
between the spheres of Saturn and Jupiter, the tetrahedron between
those of Jupiter and Mars, the dodecahedron between those of Mars
and the Earth, the icosahedron between those of the Earth and Venus,
and the octahedron between those of Venus and Mercury.
This arrangement can be investigated numerically, and it has the
force of necessity, not seeking anxiously for the number of the bodies
but using the known number. In addition, it is so well constructed
that no one has attacked it in these twenty-two years, but even the pupils
of Ramus, that hot-headed scholar, the scourge of Euclid, even they
have been drawn to it, and it now excites so much interest that mathe­
maticians are calling for a second edition to be brought out.^^ But
it is not the purpose of this second [i.e. present] book to go into details
of this theory. The reader will find more about it below, in the fifth
book, and something also in Book IV of the Epitome Astronomiae,^^
where the true origin of these five solid figures is explained in meta­
physical terms. For their origin is not really from the properties of
their solid angles but, rather, the properties of the solid angles are
a consequence of the origin of the figures, being by their very nature
something that comes later.
