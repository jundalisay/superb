## Proposition 21

The plane cannot be filled by a congruence of the individual angles of plane figures of four or more kinds.

For the 4 smallest angles are those of the trigon, the tetragon, the pentagon, and the hexagon. 

The first and last of these add up to two right angles, while the second of them is a right angle and the third is greater than a right angle, by one fifth of a right angle.

Therefore, if they are joined up they come to more than four right angles. So by XVI they do not form a congruence. We
should exceed four right angles by even more if larger angles were taken.


## Axiom 22

If 2 plane angles do not add up to more than a third one, they will not form a solid angle with it.

## Proposition 23

2 plane angles of a figure with an odd number of sides will not come together with an angle of another kind to form a regular solid.

For by Part 17, the solid angles would not all be the same, which is not in
accordance with definitions V to X.


##  Proposition 24

3 plane angles of figures of three different kinds, one kind having an odd number of sides, cannot come together in a perfect solid figure. 

For, again by 27, the solid angles would not all be the same, which is not in accordance with the definitions.


## Proposition 25

The most perfect regular congruences of plane figures to form a solid figure are five in number. 

This is a scholium to the last proposition of the last book of Euclid.

By Part 15 we must start with three plane angles, and by Part 16 we must finish at 6 trigon angles, at 4 tetragon angles and at 3 hexagon angles, since Part 18 says they add up to 4 right angles.

3e trigons, fitted together at one angle, make up less than 4 right angles in the plane, in fact they make up only two. When we make a solid angle by putting three trigons together the gap which remains can be filled by a fourth
trigon. 

This gives the Tetrahedron or Pyramid.

Four trigons, fitted together at one angle, make up eight thirds of a right angle, which is less than twelve thirds, or four right angles. Joining together the sides of the trigons we obtain a pyramid with an open four-sided base. 

Two such pyramids may be fitted together base to base to form a figure closed on all sides. This gives the Octahedron.

5 trigons, fitted together at one angle, make up 10 thirds of a right angle, which is less than 12 thirds. 

Joining the sides together two by two round the common angle we obtain a pyramid with a five-sided base. Each of the angles around the base must eventually be made up of five plane angles, so each requires another three angles in addition to the two it already has. 

Thus the 10 plane angles around the base require another 15. 15 angles will then point outwards in the opposite direction which adds up to 30 plane angles, that is the angles of 10 trigons. 

These 10 trigons make up a central zone or column, with a five-sided open end at top and bottom. Another penta­
hedral pyramid fits onto the open base, thus closing the figure all round. This gives the Icosahedron.

We have now dealt with all cases involving only trigons. 

3 tetragon angles are three right angles, less than four right angles in the plane. Therefore they can be fitted together to form a solid angle. 

When the tetragons are fitted together, they leave three gaps, and 3 angles of the plane stick out. So three more tetragons, fitted together to form a solid angle, will fit together with the first three, their points filling the gaps in the others and their gaps taking the points of the others. This gives the Hexahedron or Cube.

4 tetragon angles are 4 right angles, therefore by Part 16 they do not form a solid angle. So we have dealt with all cases forming only tetragons. 

3 pentagon angles are 18 fifths of a plane right angle, which is less than 20 fifths, or 4 right angles.

Therefore, they can be fitted together to form a solid angle. If we take one pentagon as a base and fit five others round
it in this manner, we obtain a figure with gaps which are five pentagon angles and points which stick out which are also five plane pentagon angles. 

We can then construct another similar figure, in reverse, so that the five plane angles sticking out of the second figure will fit into the five gaps of the first one, and vice versa. This produces the Dodecahedron. 

So we have dealt with all cases involving only pentagons, and thus with all those in which only one kind of figure is used: since, by XVI, three hexagons do not form a solid angle. 

These are the five bodies which the Pythagoreans and Plato, and Proclus, the commentator on Euclid, were accustomed to call the world figures, but, as I said in the introduction to Book I, it is not certain how they related
these figures to the bodies of the world.

Aristotle says that there were 5 such shapes which the philosophers related to the 5 elements: 

1. Fire
2. Air
3. Earth
4. Water
5. Fifth Essence, or celestial matter

The characteristics of the shapes are compared with the properties of the simple bodies.

The cube stands upright on a square base expressing stability.
- This is characteristic of terrestrial matter, whose weight tends down to the lowest point
- It is commonly believed, that the whole Earth is at rest at the center of the World. 

The octahedron, on the other hand, is viewed most appropriately suspended by opposite angles, as in a lathe, the square
which lies exactly midway between these angles dividing the figure into 2 equal parts, just as a globe suspended by its poles is divided by a great circle.

This is an image of mobility, as air is the most mobile of the elements, in speed and direction.

The tetrahedron’s small number of faces is seen as signifying the dryness of fire, since dry things, by definition, keep within their own boundaries.

The large number of faces of the icosahedron, on the other hand, is seen as signifying the wetness of water, since wetness,
by definition, is held within the boundaries of other things.

A few faces indicate that many from another body will be associated with them.

Furthermore, the plane trigon is proper to the tetrahedron, since the complete tetrahedral figure is a solid trigon,
while the same trigon is not proper to the icosahedron, but, rather,
incidental to it, since the solid shape of the icosahedron is like a
pentagon, not a trigon. Again, the tetrahedron’s point, rising from one
face, is seen as expressive of the penetrating and dividing power of
fire, while the blunt quinquelinear angle of the icosahedron expresses
the filling power of humours, that is their power to wet.

The small thin tetrahedron shows the nature of fire; the large rounded mass of the icosahedron shows the nature of water, and as it were the shape of a drop.

The tetrahedron has a very large surface and a very small body; the icosahedron has a bodily mass much greater than its surface: just as in fire it is the form that predominates and in water it
is the matter.

The dodecahedron is left for the celestial body, having the same number of faces as the Zodiac has signs. It can be shown that it has 

1 1
1
the greatest volume of all the figures, just as the heavens enclose every­
thing else.
Although this analogy is acceptable, though not to Aristotle (who
did not believe that the World had been created and thus could not
recognize the power of these quantitative figures as archetypes, be­
cause without an architect there is no such power in them to make
anything corporeal), yet it is acceptable to me and to all Christians,
since our Faith holds that the World, which had no previous existence,
was created by God in weight, measure, and number, that is in accor­
dance with ideas coeternal with Him; although, I say, this sort of anal­
ogy is acceptable, yet framed in this manner it has no force of neces­
sity; indeed, it admits of other interpretations, not only because certain
properties are at variance within the analogy, but also because the
dodecahedron and icosahedron correspond more closely with fire,
and finally because the number of the elements and whether the Earth
is at rest are matters much more open to dispute than is the number
of the figures.


<!-- If the Pythagoreans held out against this theory,  -->

I do not blame Ramus, or Aristotle, for rejecting this disputed analogy. 24 years ago I found out a very different relation between these 5 shapes and the fabric of the world.

My introduction to Book 1 said that some of the ancients had been of this same opinion also, but had kept it secret, in the manner of their sect. 

For Copernican Astronomy, or the Astronomy of the ancient Pythagorean Aristarchus of Samos, describes the moving world as containing 6 spheres or paths surrounding the motionless body of the Sun, which is in the center, the spheres being separated from one another by large and unequal intervals.

The outermost sphere is that of Saturn, the next that of Jupiter, then that of Mars, then that of the Earth and the Moon, then that of Venus and lastly that of Mercury, the innermost.

Now we know that it is a fundamental property of these 5 shapes that they can be inscribed within a spherical surface so that their angles are on the surface, and can also be circumscribed about a spherical surface so as to touch it at the centers of their faces; moreover, for any particular figure there is a particular interval between the 2 spheres defined in this way. Nothing seems more likely than that the 5 intervals between the six celestial spheres were taken by the Creator
from the five figures, in an order such that the cube is to be imagined between the spheres of Saturn and Jupiter, the tetrahedron between those of Jupiter and Mars, the dodecahedron between those of Mars and the Earth, the icosahedron between those of the Earth and Venus, and the octahedron between those of Venus and Mercury.

This arrangement can be investigated numerically, and it has the force of necessity, not seeking anxiously for the number of the bodies but using the known number.

In addition, it is so well constructed that no one has attacked it in these twenty-two years, but even the pupils of Ramus, that hot-headed scholar, the scourge of Euclid, even they have been drawn to it, and it now excites so much interest that mathematicians are calling for a second edition to be brought out.^^ 

But it is not the purpose of this second [i.e. present] book to go into details of this theory. The reader will find more about it below, in Book 5, and something also in Book IV of the Epitome Astronomiae, where the true origin of these five solid figures is explained in metaphysical terms.

For their origin is not really from the properties of their solid angles but, rather, the properties of the solid angles are
a consequence of the origin of the figures, being by their very nature something that comes later.
