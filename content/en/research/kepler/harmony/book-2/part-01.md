I Definition

Congruence takes one form in the plane and another in space. In the
plane there is congruence when individual angles'‘ of several figures
come together at a point in such a way that they leave no gap.

II Definition

Congruence is said to be perfect when the angles of the figure which
come together do so in the same way at each meeting-point, so that
these meeting-points are similar to one another and the pattern of
meeting-points can be continued indefinitely.

III Definition

Congruence is said to be most perfect when, in addition, the figures
which come together in the plane are all of the same kind.

IV Definition

Congruence is said to be imperfect when some larger figure is sur­
rounded by similar meeting-points but the congruence cannot be con­
tinued indefinitely or can be so continued only by introducing meet­
ing points of different kinds. The congruence is imperfect, and of lower
degree, when the larger figure cannot be surrounded in such a way
that similar meeting-points are formed at all its angles.

V Definition

There is congruence in space, and a solid figure, when the individual
angles of several plane figures make up a solid angle, and regular or
semi-regular'’ figures are fitted together so as to leave no gap between

the sides of the figures, which join up on the opposite side of the solid
figure, or, if a gap is left, it is such that it can be filled by a figure of
one of the kinds already employed, or, at least, by a regular figure.
Note that there is another form of congruence, not of plane figures to form
a solid figure but of these solid figures among themselves, to fill space all round
a point. There are only two figures which will form such congruences: the cube
and the rhombic dodecahedron. Eight cube angles^ will meet at a point and
fill space all round it. The rhombic figure has two types of angle: eight obtuse
trilinear angles and six acute quadrilinear angles. Four obtuse angles will join
to fill space, and so will six acute ones. The result is like the way in which bees
construct their honeycomb: the cells are contiguous and the end of each is sur­
rounded by three opposing ends while its sides are surrounded by the sides of
six more cells. Three more cells could be added at the other end to complete the
figure, except that the entrances to the cells must remain open. We are not con­
cerned here with this congruence of solid figures."^
VI Definition
Congruence in space is said to be most perfect, as is also the solid
formed, when, in addition, the plane figures which form the congru­
ence are all the same shape.
VII Definition
On the one hand, the solid formed is completely regular when the
plane figures are regular. All its angles then lie on the same spherical
surface and are all similar to one another.
VIII Definition
On the other hand, the solid formed is semiregular when the plane
figures are semiregular (see Book I, Definition III). Its solid angles are
then not all the same, but differ in the number of lines they contain,
though the angles are not of more than two kinds, and neither are
they distributed on more than two spherical surfaces, which are con­
centric. The number of angles of each kind must be the same as the
number of angles of one of the regular solid figures.^
There is no reason why we should not call this congruence most perfect.

for its imperfection is in the faces and is not a consequence of its being solid
but, rather, an accidental feature. So this semiregular congruence will equally
be called most perfect.
IX Definition
A congruence is perfect, but of a lower degree, when the plane figures
are regular and all the angles lie on the same spherical surface and
are similar to one another, but the faces are of various kinds, though
the number of each kind must be the same as the number of faces
of one of the most perfect figures, that is, not less than four, which
is the minimum number of planes to bound a solid figure.
X Definition
There is an imperfect congruence or figure when other conditions
remain the same but the larger plane figure does not occur more than
once or twice.
The solid figure formed will either be more like a part of a figure than a
whole one^ or it will be more like a plane figure than a solid, since any solid
figure is bounded by at least four surfaces. Such figures are shown in the plate,
marked A and B, where the larger figure is a heptagon. These two classes ex­
tend indefinitely as the number of sides of the larger figure increases. They each
start with the trigon, which in class A gives us one of the most perfect regular
congruences.^^ Proceeding to the tetragon we then obtain one of the most per­
fect congruences in class
All other congruences of these types are imperfect.
XI Definition
A congruence is semisolid when it does not satisfy all the conditions
of Definition V, so that as the plane figures are fitted together the con­
gruence does not completely Join up with itself but leaves a gap. Apart
from this. Definitions VI and Vll apply to such congruences.

12.. Definition
Plane figures are congruent when they either enclose a solid figure
or fill the plane without leaving a gap, the figures themselves being
regular or semiregular.
