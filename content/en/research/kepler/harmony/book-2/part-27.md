## Proposition 27

Most perfect solid congruences are also formed by semiregular figures, that is plane rhombi, and there are only two cases.
From twelve plane rhombi whose diagonals are in a particular ratw we may make a solid rhombus which has the shape of a honeycomb cell, that is, it has six sides and an end in the form of a trihedral angle. 

For if 6 rhombi are fitted together in such a way that obtuse angles meet obtuse angles and acute angles meet acute angles, then there will be three obtuse-angled gaps and acute-angled projections above, and the same will happen below. So three rhombi may be fitted in both above and below, with their obtuse angles fitted together to make a solid point and their remaining angles going into the gaps in the first figure, while the gaps left between the three new rhombi take the projecting points of the original figure.

In fact, the gaps can be filled with regular polygons: triangles for the eared cube and pentagons for the eared dodecahedron. See Badoureau (1881) and Field
(1979a).

See note 5 above.

The ratio of the diagonals is t V2. See also next note.

Similarly, 30 plane rhombi, with a different ratio between their diagonals,^^ make a solid triacontahedral
rhombus. The rhombi are joined together at their acute angles. Jive by Jive, to give
two solid angles pointing in opposite directions.

There are gaps left where the obtuse angles meet. Each set of Jive
gaps is then Jilled by the obtuse angles
of a further five rhombi, and between
these two shell-likefigures we introduce
a zone made of ten rhombi joined together.

This is then joined to each shell.

We can show as follows that there are no further perfect congruences of rhombi. Two of the angles of a plane rhombus are acute and two obtuse, the sum of one acute angle and one obtuse one being two right angles. 

Further, it is not possible to put together more than three obtuse angles, since their sum would be greater than four right angles. By joining up only three acute angles one obtains something like a cube, a rhombic hexahedron, which has only two
acute solid angles, the pair furthest away from one another.

The other solid angles, in the middle of the body, lie closer together. The body does not satisfy Part 8, which does not admit cases where only two solid angles lie on the same sphere. Moreover, each of the six obtuse solid angles is formed by two obtuse plane angles and one acute one, an irregularity which is once more con­
trary to the definitions. Therefore we may not fit together only three acute plane
angles. 

But six angles, of six rhombi, will not fit together either. For if the individual acute angles are each two thirds of a right angle, the obtuse angles will be twice that size, that is four thirds. Thus both three obtuse angles and
six acute angles will add up to four right angles, and neither the one set nor
the other will form a solid angle, but instead the rhombi will cover the plane
continuously, as in G. 

If we now take smaller acute angles the corresponding obtuse angles will be larger than before and three of them will add up to more than 4 right angles.

Therefore there are only two most perfect congruences of rhombi: one in which four acute angles of the rhombi make up a solid angle and another in which five do. However, the cube might be added to the list, as the first rhombic solid, for its faces also have four equal sides, as do those of the solid rhombi.

In these three figures we have tetragons combined with trigons. In what follows we shall combine each of them separately with pentagons. 

Five trigon angles will not combine with a pentagon angle, since they will not even combine with a tetragon
angle, which is smaller. 

Four trigon angles and one pentagon angle make less than four right angles, and
eighty (that is 20 and 60) trigons will fit together with 12
pentagons to make an enenecontahaedyhedron, which I call a snub do­
decahedron.

It is shown here numbered 13. In this series of snubfigures the icosahedron could make a third,
since it is like a snub tetrahedron. 

If you combine 3 trigon angles with one pentagon angle the result is as described above, namely
that the solid formed includes only 2 pentagons.

If you combine 2 trigon angles with one pentagon angle the solid includes only 1 pentagon.

The former case gives a zone or central column and the latter gives a pyramid, both parts of an icosahedron.  

The solid angles of the second body are not all the same, since one is surrounded by 5 trigon angles, as in an icosahedron.
We have now dealt with all the cases involving only one pentagon angle.

Three trigon angles with two pentagon angles make more than four right angles. So we have dealt with all the cases in which three trigon angles are combined with pentagon angles.

Two trigon angles with two pentagon angles make less than four right angles.

Thus 20 trigons and twelve pentagons fit together to make a triacontakaedyhedron, which I call an icosidodecahedron.''^ It is shown here numbered 9. 

Since we have already rejected the case in which two trigon angles are joined up with one pentagon angle we have now dealt with all the cases involving two trigons.

One trigon angle added to three pentagon angles makes more than four right angles, and if it is joined up with two pentagon angles it cannot make a regular solid, by XXIII, since the pentagon has an odd number of sides.

So we have now dealt with all the cases involving pentagons combined with
trigons.

Four trigon angles with one hexagon angle, and two trigon angles with two hexagon angles fill the plane around a point; three trigon angles with two hexagon angles are greater than four right angles, and with only one hexagon angle they
give a figure which contains only two hexagons.

So we must reject cases involving 3 trigon angles. Two trigon angles are equal to one hexagon angle, so
this case is also rejected, by XXII. 

It remains to unite one trigon angle with two hexagon angles. Thus four trigons and four hexagons fit together to make
an octahedron, which I call a truncated tetrahedron.

It is shown as number 2 vi Truncated on the next page.
tetrahedron.

Four trigon angles with one heptagon angle, or a larger angle, come to more than four right angles, so we need not discuss cases involving four trigon angles, nor cases involving three, for reasons already given. 

In fact, two trigon angles with 2 plane angles larger than those of the hexagon come to more than 4 right angles, so we do not need to discuss cases involving two trigon angles joined with two plane angles of a figure larger than the hexagon, rwr cases involving two trigon angles joined with one plane angle of a larger figure, because
such an angle is larger than two trigon angles, so the case is rejected by axiom 22. 

It remains for us to examine the case in which one trigon angle is united with two plane angles of a figure larger than a hexagon. The case in which these are two heptagon angles is rejected by XXIII, as are all the cases involving
two angles of a figure with an odd number of sides. With two octagon angles
we obtain a solid in which eight trigons join up with six octagons to make a
tessarakaedecahedron, which I call a truncated cube.

There is a diagram of vii Truncated it numbered 1 on the following page. With two decagon angles we obtain a solid
in which twenty trigons join up with twelve decagons to make a triacontakaedy-
hedron which I call a truncated dodecahedron.

This is shown below as number viii Truncated 3. With two dodecagon angles the plane is filled, so no solid angle can be made dodecahedron. 
with these or any still larger angles. We have thus entirely finished with cases
involving trigons together with any other single kind of figure.

Since the 2 kinds of plane figure will no longer include trigons the smallest figure involved will now be the tetragon. Three tetragon angles with one larger angle come to more than 4 right angles, and by definition IX we know
we cannot combine two tetragon angles with one larger angle, since only 2 of the larger figures will occur in the resultant solid. 

The case of one tetragon angle combined with two pentagon angles is rejected, by XXIII, but one tetragon angle will go with two hexagon angles, and six tetragons and eight hexagons will fit together to make a tessarakaedecahedron which I call a truncated ix Truncated octahedron.

t is shown as number 5 in the diagram below. The case of one tetragon angle combined with two heptagon angles is rejected because the heptagon has an odd number of sides, that is by XXIII. With two octagon angles the plane is filled. With larger angles the sum exceeds four right angles and no solid angle can be formed. 

So we have dealt with all the cases involving the tetragon, since there must be only 2 kinds of plane figure.

Two pentagon angles combined with one hexagon angle or the angle of any other figure will not form a congruence, by XXIII, so these cases must be rejected, just as we earlier rejected the cases involving a trigon angle or a tetragon angle combined with two pentagon angles. 

Moreover, two pentagon angles combined with one decagon angle cover the plane, so neither with this angle nor with a larger one will they form a solid angle.

Now one pentagon angle with two hexagon angles comes to less than 4 right angles, and twelve pentagons and twenty hexagons willfit together to make a triacontakaedyhedron, which I call a truncated icosahedron.

It is shown numbered 4. We cannot expect any more congruences from the pentagon. For one pentagon angle combined with two heptagon angles is already larger than 4 right angles.

One hexagon angle with 2 others fills the plane, and with two larger angles the sum exceeds four right angles. 

So we have now dealt with all the cases in which two kinds of figure are combined.

Turning to cases in which 3 kinds of face may fit together to make a solid angle, we first note that two plane angles, one from a tetragon and one from a pentagon, add up to more than 2 right angles, and larger angles add up to even more, so since 3 trigon angles come to two right angles, it is clear that the two plane angles
we have mentioned will not fit together with three trigon angles, for
the total sum would be more than 4 right angles. The cases in which two trigon angles are combined with one
tetragon angle and one pentagon angle, or, instead of the pentagon angle, a
hexagon angle or some larger one, all these cases are to be rejected, by proposition
XXIII, because they would require the trigon, which has an odd number of sides,

to be surrounded by tetragons and either pentagons or, instead of the pentagons,
hexagons, etc.

One trigon angle, two tetragon angles and one pentagon angle add up to xi Rhombico-
less than four right angles, and twenty trigons, thirty tetragons and twelve penta- s> 4 «decahedron.
gons will fit together to make a hexacontadyhedron which I call a rhombicosido-
decahedron or a truncated icosidodecahedral rhombus:'^ It is shown as number
11 on the previous page.

One trigon angle and two tetragon angles combined with one hexagon angle come to 4 right angles; with a larger angle they come to more; so they do not form a solid angle.

Let us therefore dismiss cases involving two tetragon angles.

One trigon angle, one tetragon angle and two pentagon angles add up to more than four right angles, and they add up to even more with two larger angles.

So we have finished with cases in which four plane angles are put together to form a solid angle, and also with cases in which the trigon angle is one of the 3 kinds of angle involved. 

For the case of one trigon angle and one tetragon angle and either one pentagon angle or any other angle is to be rejected,
by XXIV, since the trigon has an odd number of sides.

In fact, since we are now combining only three plane angles, no figure with an odd number of sides can be admitted, by XXIV again. 

A tetragon angle with a hexagon angle and an octagon angle, the smallest xii Truncated admissible angles, comes to less than four right angles; and twelve tetragons, cuboctahedron. eight hexagons and six octagons will fit together to make an icosihexahedron which I call a truncated cuboctahedron: not because it can be formed by trun­
cation but because it is like a cuboctahedron that has been truncated.'^^ It is
shown numbered 6.

A tetragon angle with a hexagon angle and a decagon angle comes to less xiii Truncated than four right angles; and thirty tetragons, twenty hexagons and twelve deca- »cosidodeca- hedron.

gons fit together to make a hexacontadyhedron which I call a truncated icosido-
decahedron, for reasons similar to those given in the previous case.^^ It is shown
numbered 7.

If we replace the decagon angle by a dodecagon angle the sum is 4 right angles and we cannot make a solid angle; also, if we replace the hexagon angle by an octagon angle and take as our third angle any angle larger than an octagon angle we have more than four right angles; nor is the sum less if we set aside the tetragon angle and instead join up three angles from larger figures with an even number of sides. 

Therefore the whole family of Archimedean solids numbers 13, as was to be shown.


XXIX Conclusion

The degrees of congruence are distinct. The trigon and the tetra­
gon are of the first degree, because they form congruences in space
as well as in the plane, both among themselves, with figures all of one
kind, and also when combined with other figures.
The pentagon and its star are of the second degree. For in space
they will form congruences among themselves, with figures all of one
kind, and in the plane they come to one another’s aid, but the pen­
tagon is the more powerful of the two because it will also form con­
gruences with some other figures, both in the plane and in space.
The hexagon is of the third degree, because figures of this kind
form congruences in the plane, and in combination with other figures
will form congruences both in the plane and in space.
The fourth degree is taken by the octagon and the decagon and
their stars. For the basic figures will form solid congruences with some
other figures and the stars will form congruences with figures all of
one kind at least to a limited extent.^’ In the plane all four figures
form congruences with others, the octagonal figures doing so in more
ways and more perfectly.
The fifth degree is that of the dodecagon and its star, because in
space they do not form any congruences at all whereas in the plane
they combine with other figures to form many different congruences.
In space it is only their size which prevents them forming congruences.
As far as congruence in the plane is concerned this group should be
of the fourth degree.
The icosigon is of the last degree, because this figure will form
congruences only in the plane and then only when combined with
other figures, and, moreover, these congruences are imperfect.
So if we consider only the plane, the order of the figures will be
the following: I. Hexagon, 2. Tetragon, 3. Trigon, 4. Dodecagon, 5. Its
star, 6 . Octagon, 7. Its star, 8 . Pentagon, 9. Its star, 10. Decagon, 11. Its
star, 12. Icosigon.
All other figures are incapable of forming congruences, though
the figure that comes closest to doing so is the pentekaedecagon, be­
cause it begins to form congruences with other figures in the plane

but it is excluded, by XX , because, unlike the icosigon, it cannot be
surrounded at all its angles in the same way. After that comes the figure
with sixteen sides and others like it, which do not form plane con­
gruences with other regular figures because their angles are too large.
But the heptagon and similar figures do not form congruences for
a quite different reason, namely because neither whole angles nor
aliquot parts of an angle of such a figure are able to form congruences
with other regular figures.
So congruence can be divided into three demonstrably distinct
classes: the octagon class, the decagon class, and the icosigon class,
together with a fourth, spurious, class in which there is no congru­
ence. These classes will find their application in the choice of Aspects
in Book IV.

From this we see that there is a genuine difference between construction and congruence in respect of the width of the classes they form. 

For, I. The degrees of proper construction extend to infinity from the octagon, decagon, and dodecagon to include all figures that can be obtained by successive doubling of the number of sides; congru­
ence is confined to the degrees of the octagon, the icosigon, and the
dodecagon. 

2. In respect of construction and knowledge the pentagon and its star are less noble than the dodecagon; in respect of congruence in space they are much nobler. 

3. In construction and knowledge the octagon ranks lower than the pentagon but takes precedence over it in congruence. 

4. The hekkaedecagon was higher placed than the icosigon for construction, yet the former will not form congruences
whereas the latter will, to a limited extent. 

5. But the pentekaedecagon shows a pleasing uniformity of properties in these two respects: since it has no proper construction but only an accidental one and it will not form any complete congruences but only the beginning of a con­
gruence which does not surround the whole figure. 

These properties are to be taken into account below in
