## Proposition 19


There are 6 ways in which the plane can be filled around a point by 2 kinds of shapes:

- 2 ways use 5 angles
- 1 way uses 4 angles
- 3 ways using 3 angles

6 plane figures cannot fit together since the angle of one of them must be larger than the angle of the trigon. 

The angle of the trigon, the first of the polygons, is 2/3 of a right angle, so taking it 6 times gives 12 thirds,
or 4 right angles. 

So if one of the 6 angles were larger, that is if it were the angle of a higher polygon, the sum would be more than four right angles, so the plane is not covered, by XVI of this book.

1. 5 shapes fit together if 4 trigon angles are combined with another angle equal to 2 trigon angles, that is a hexagon angle. The form is shown in L.

2. 5 figures fit if 3 trigon angles are combined with 2 tetragon angles, because the last two add up to three more trigon angles. 

The form is as shown in `M`, or `N`, both of which forms can be extended uniformly, or it is as shown in `O`, a form which cannot be extended uniformly.

But if you take two trigon angles with three tetragon angles they will come to more than four right angles. The sum is even larger if you add two^^ larger angles to two trigon angles.

3. Four figures of two kinds fit together if two trigon angles are combined with 2 hexagon angles. 

The form is either as shown in P or as shown in R. 

Whatever other four angles you fit together you always get more or less than 4 right angles so you do not fill the plane.
If we join up three angles, taking care not to use more than two kinds of angle, we may begin by ruling out cases which use two trigon angles or 2 tetragon angles, for these do not come to more than two right angles and the gap they leave for the third angle is therefore too large for any one angle to fill on its own.

4. Now if we assume one of the three angles to be a trigon angle, we obtain a congruence with two dodecagon angles. 

This pattern can be continued without involving any different kind of meeting-point. The result in the plane is as shown in S.

Here we must consider the star dodecagon, because its re-entrant angles are equal to a trigon angle, so that a dodecagon can be divided up into a star and twelve trigons. Therefore, five trigon angles and two points of two stars
will fit together. The form, which can be continued, is as seen marked with the
letter T.

If a tetragon angle is taken as one of the three, there is a congruence with two octagon angles, and this form too may be continued. 

It is seen marked with the letter V.

Here we must consider the star octagon, because its re-entrant angles are equal to a tetragon angle, so that an octagon can be divided up into a star and eight right-angled triangles, two of which make a tetragon. 

Thus 3 tetragon angles and 2 points of 2 stars fill the plane.

The mixed form is as shown marked with `X`, or otherwise, again mixed, marked `Y`.

6. Having dealt with sets of three angles which include trigon angles and tetragon angles, if we now come to the pentagon angle we may take two of them, because together they come to more than two right angles; and a decagon angle fits into
the space they leave. The decagon is encircled by ten pentagons, but this pattern
z. cannot be continued in its pure form. See the inner part of diagram Z.
Here we must consider the star pentagon, since we can fit together three
pentagon angles and one point of a star, because the re-entrant angle of the
star takes one pentagon angle while, no less, the gap left by fitting together three
pentagon angles takes the point of the star. See the outer part of the same
z. diagram Z.

However, this pattern cannot be continued indefinitely, for the domain it builds up is unsociable^^ and when it has added to its size a little it builds fortifications. You may see a different arrangement of these two forms marked
Aa.

with the letters Aa.

If you really wish to continue the pattern, certain irregularities must be admitted, two decagons must be combined, two sides being removed from each of them.

As the pattern is continued outwardsfive-corneredforms appear repeatedly: in the first and smallest of the five-cornered ranks there are five decagons with no intermediate irregularity, in the second and wider rank lines of single decagons
lie between decagons joined in pairs, in the third rank the corners are taken
by pairs of joined decagons and between two such pairs there lies a simple decagon,
in the fourth rank we again have simple decagons in the corners and on the
side between them there are two more decagons, spaced at equal intervals, in
the fifth rank the corners are marked by the tips of the outermost points of stars
and the sides each contain two simple decagons between which there are two
pairs of combined decagons. So as it progresses this five-cornered pattern con­
tinually introduces something new. The structure is very elaborate and intricate.
Aa.

See the diagram marked Aa.

Here we must also consider the star decagon, whose re-entrant angle fits around the angle of a pentagon. 

In this way two of the points, each one 3 tenths of a right angle, join up with two pentagon angles to fill the plane around a point. This pattern takes in pentagons of a different size. It can be continued.

ut the continuation includes incomplete open decagons. The pattern is shown
marked with the letters Bb.
Bb.

We cannot take a single pentagon as one of the three plane figures which are to form a congruence, for its angle is six fifths of a right angle, by Book 1 Part 33, so the remaining 2 angles would be left with 14 fifths of a right angle, that is each would be 7 fifths, which is not the angle of any regular figure.

Nor can we take 2 hexagons, for the remainder is also the angle of a hexagon and we shall obtain theform of congruence already described above, and we are now looking for structures involving two kinds offigure, not only one kind. 

As for the higher polygons, whose angles are greater than that of the hexagon, when two such angles are subtracted from four right angles the remainder is less than the angle of a hexagon; taking one angle from four right
angles, what is left for the remaining two angles of the proposed congruence
is less than two hexagon angles. 

We have already dealt with those figures whose angles are smaller than that of the hexagon, so we have dealt with all the ways of covering the plane with three figures at each meeting-point.


##  Proposition 20

There are 4 ways in which the plane can be filled by the congruence of plane angles of 3 kinds.

Here we cannot use three or more trigon angles at each meeting-point, for 3 trigon angles make two right angles, and so leave a gap which is less than the sum of the angles of the next 2 polygons, the tetragon and the pentagon.

This is why we cannot employ 2 trigon angles with 2 tetragon angles, or with larger ones, since they do not leave enough space for the angle of the third kind of figure.

1. So if we have two trigon angles and one tetragon angle, the dodecagon angle will join up with them. However, this pattern cannot be continued. See letters Cc, Dd, and Ee, which show three forms, all belonging to the first case of the
proposition.

Here, as above, we must consider the star dodecagon. For four trigon angles,
one tetragon angle and one point of the star will fill the plane. See forms F f
Gg, and Hh.

If a pentagon angle is joined up with two trigon angles the remainder will be incongruent, being twenty-two twenty-fifths of a right angle, for there is no angle of a regular figure which is eleven twenty-fifths. If one hexagon angle is
added to two trigon angles the remainder will also be a hexagon angle, and
the form will be one of those described above. So there are no more plane con­
gruences involving two trigons.

So let there be one trigon angle. Three tetragon angles cannot be added to it, because then the sum is too large and there will not be enough space left for the angle of the third kind.

2. To one trigon angle let us add two tetragon angles. When we subtract the sum from four right angles the remainder is the angle of a hexagon. 

This pattern takes two forms: the one shown at li can he continued, the one shown at `Kk` cannot be continued without additional figures. This is the second case of the proposition.

A single trigon angle cannot join up with two pentagon angles, because the gap left is fourteen fifteenths of a right angle, an angle not found in regular figures. 

Nor can a single trigon angle join up with one pentagon angle, because the gap left would be thirty-two fifteenths of a right angle and no regular figure has an angle of 16 fifteenths. 

Nor can a trigon angle join up with one hexagon angle, because they come to two right angles, and no single angle is that size; and half of the gap is the size of the tetragon angle, which we have already dealt with. 

Nor can a trigon angle join up with one angle of a heptagon or of an octagon or of an enneagon, for the gap left for the third kind of angle would be 40 21s of a right angle or 11 16ths or 16 9ths, none of which is the angle of a regular figure.

A trigon angle combined with a decagon angle leaves a gap of 26 15ths of a right angle, which is the angle of the pentehaedecagon. 

These figures do form a congruence, but a limited one. For the pentehaedecagon has an odd number of sides, so by XVII the meeting-points at the angles of the figure will not all be the same.

Since the decagon has an even number of sides it can be surrounded by alternate trigons and pentekaedecagons, but two of the
pentekaedecagons immediately run up against one another and prevent the pattern from being continued.

Further, a trigon cannot be joined with a hendecagon, for this would leave fifty-six thirty-thirds of a right angle, which is not the angle of any regular figure.

Next, a trigon angle taken together with a dodecagon angle leaves a gap the size of a decagon angle, a form we have already discussed. 

If a trigon angle is subtracted from four right angles, the space left is not great enough to fit in angles of two other kinds, which together would come to more than two right angles.

3. One tetragon angle joined up with one pentagon angle leaves a gap the sizeof an icosigon angle. 

An icosigon can therefore fit together with two such angles at every one of its own angles, forming a true congruence, but this pattern cannot be continued outwards. It is therefore an imperfect congruence. See figure Ll. This is the third case of the proposition.

4. A tetragon angle joined up with a hexagon angle leaves a gap the size of a dodecagon angle. See figure Mm. This is the fourth and last case of the proposition.

Here we must consider the star decagon which can be filled out with 12 trigons. 

Four angles thus fit together to fill the space: two trigon angles, one tetragon angle, one hexagon angle, and a point of the star. See figure Nn.

If a tetragon angle is added to a heptagon angle it leaves a gap of 11 sevenths of a right angle, an angle not found in any regular figure. 

Added to an octagon angle, a tetragon angle leaves a gap the size of an octagon angle.

We have discussed this form above. We have therefore dealt with all the cases involving a tetragon angle.

A pentagon angle together with a hexagon angle leaves a gap of 22 15ths of a right angle. Taken together with a heptagon angle it leaves forty-eight thirty-fifths; with an octa^n angle thirteen tenths, while no such angle
is to be found in any regular figure.

Taking a pentagon angle with angles of figures having more sides than an octagon] the gap left starts to be less than an octagon angle, which is fifteen tenths of a right angle. But we  have already dealt with congruences involving smaller angles. We have therefore dealt with all the cases involving a pentagon angle.

3 hexagon angles fill the plane, so a hexagon angle cannot be combined with two angles larger than itself.

We have therefore dealt with all cases involving figures of 3 different kinds.
