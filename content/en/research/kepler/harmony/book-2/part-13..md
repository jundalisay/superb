XIII Definition
A,B.
Let us call incongruent those regular plane figures inscribed in a circle
(if they can be inscribed) which not only cannot form, either alone
or with other plane figures of their own or another class, a solid figure,
other than a somewhat imperfect one, which can be inscribed in a
spherical surface, but also cannot cover the plane, either by themselves
or with stars of their own class, or with figures and stars of another
class around them.
Note that I have excluded the heptagon and suchlike figures, despite the
fact that two parallel heptagons together with seven square or fourteen regular
triangles do form a completely closed solid figure, because only two heptagons
are involved, and the figure formed is discus-shaped, like a plane, not globe-
shaped, like a sphere. See the figures marked A and B in the engraved plate
following page
The fifteen-sided figure is also excluded in the same way,
despite the fact that some of its angles may be surrounded by related figures
to cover the plane, because in this case the figure is not completely surrounded
at all its angles.
XIV Proposition
At least three plane angles are required to form a congruence in the
plane.
For around any meeting-point the sum of the angles is four right angles.
But no figure has an angle greater than two right angles, therefore two such
angles are less than four right angles. So two of them cannot fill the plane,
by Definition I.
XV Proposition
At least three plane angles must fit together or rise up to form a solid
angle.
For two plane angles would meet not only at their sides but with their whole
surfaces, which is contrary to Euclid’s definition of a solid angle.'^'^
XVI Proposition
The sum of angles congruent in the plane is always four right angles,
never more. The sum of angles which form a solid congruence is less
than four right angles.
For in a plane there are no more than four right angles around a point,
therefore when the sum of the angles is equal to four right angles no gap is
left, and by Definition I there is then congruence in the plane. If the angles
cover the plane they do not rise from it to form a solid angle. And, on the other
hand, if the angles fitted together in the plane leave a gap, that is if they come to less than four right angles, then drawing together the two sides round the
gap, and so eliminating it, necessitates raising the angle and making it a solid one.
Figure H in the engraved plate, following page 53,'-’ shows three pentagons
lying in the plane and leaving a gap.

XVII Proposition
A figure with an odd number of sides, around which figures of two
kinds are fitted, cannot form a congruence which is the same at every
angle, either in the plane or in space.
For one angle of the figure will have the same figure on both sides of it,
which is not the case for the other angles. The reason for this can be seen in
figure C of the engraved plate below.

XVIII Proposition
There are only three ways in which the plane can be filled most per­
fectly around a point, in each case using figures of only one kind: by
using six trigons, or four tetragons, or three hexagons.
For by XXXIII of the first book of this work the angle of a trigon is two
thirds of a right angle, therefore the six angles of six trigons are twelve thirds,
D.
that is four whole right angles. See D.^^
Similarly, the angle of a tetragon is one right angle, therefore the four angles
offour tetragons make four right angles. See E. Similarly, the angle of a hexagon E.
is eight sixths of a right angle, therefore three angles of three figures make twenty-
four sixths, that is four right angles. See E But the angle of a pentagon is less
than that of a hexagon, therefore three of them are less than four right angles
and leave a gap. The angle of a pentagon is larger than that of a tetragon,
therefore four pentagon angles are more than four right angles, therefore they cannot
be contained around a point in a plane, by XVI of this book. For this see H,
where the fourth pentagon is shown dotted. Similarly, the angles of a heptagon
and of all larger figures are greater than that of a hexagon, so three heptagon
angles are more than four right angles. See I, where two of the heptagons partly
overlap in the plane.
Here we must consider rhombi made up of two regular trigons. They form
a most perfect congruence, like regular hexagons, although they are semiregular
figures. This congruence can be seen in the engraved plate, labelled G.
Here we must also consider the six-cornered stars we obtain by removing
six points from a star dodecagon.^'^ See letter K. For where we have removed
a point we have a re-entrant angle, equal to a right angle. Therefore three tet­
ragons and three points of these stars fill the plane. For the hexagon can be
divided up into one such star and six half-tetragons.


XIX Proposition


There are six ways in which the plane can be filled around a point
by figures of two kinds: in two ways using five angles, in one way using
four angles and in three ways using three angles.
Six plane figures cannot fit together, since the angle of one of them must
be larger than the angle of the trigon. The angle of the trigon, the first of the
polygons, is two thirds of a right angle, so taking it six times gives twelve thirds,
or four right angles. So if one of the six angles were larger, that is if it were
the angle of a higher polygon, the sum would be more than four right angles,
so the plane is not covered, by XVI of this book.
1. Five figures fit together if four trigon angles are combined with another angle
equal to two trigon angles, that is a hexagon angle. The form is shown in L.
2. Again, five figures fit if three trigon angles are combined with two tetragon
angles, because the last two add up to three more trigon angles. The form is
as shown in M, or N, both of which forms can be extended uniformly, or it is
as shown in O, a form which cannot be extended uniformly.^^ But if you take
two trigon angles with three tetragon angles they will come to more than four
right angles. The sum is even larger if you add two^^ larger angles to two tri­
gon angles.
3. Four figures of two kinds fit together if two trigon angles are combined with
two hexagon angles. The form is either as shown in P or as shown in R.
Whatever other four angles you fit together you always get more or less than
four right angles so you do not fill the plane.
If we join up three angles, taking care not to use more than two kinds of
angle, we may begin by ruling out cases which use two trigon angles or two
tetragon angles, for these do not come to more than two right angles and the
gap they leave for the third angle is therefore too large for any one angle to
fill on its own.
4. Now if we assume one of the three angles to be a trigon angle, we obtain
a congruence with two dodecagon angles. This pattern can be continued without
involving any different kind of meeting-point. The result in the plane is as
shown in S.
Here we must consider the star dodecagon, because its re-entrant angles
are equal to a trigon angle, so that a dodecagon can be divided up into a star
and twelve trigons. Therefore, five trigon angles and two points of two stars
will fit together. The form, which can be continued, is as seen marked with the
letter T.

. And if a tetragon angle is taken as one of the three, there is a congruence
with two octagon angles, and this form too may be continued. It is seen marked
with the letter V.
Here we must consider the star octagon, because its re-entrant angles are
equal to a tetragon angle, so that an octagon can be divided up into a star and
eight right-angled triangles, two of which make a tetragon. And thus three tetra­
gon angles and two points of two stars fill the plane. The mixed form is as shown
marked with the letter X, or otherwise, again mixed, marked Y.
6. Having dealt with sets of three angles which include trigon angles and tetragon
angles, if we now come to the pentagon angle we may take two of them, because
together they come to more than two right angles; and a decagon angle fits into
the space they leave. The decagon is encircled by ten pentagons, but this pattern
z. cannot be continued in its pure form. See the inner part of diagram Z.
Here we must consider the star pentagon, since we can fit together three
pentagon angles and one point of a star, because the re-entrant angle of the
star takes one pentagon angle while, no less, the gap left by fitting together three
pentagon angles takes the point of the star. See the outer part of the same
z. diagram Z.
However, this pattern cannot be continued indefinitely, for the domain it
builds up is unsociable^^ and when it has added to its size a little it builds
fortifications. You may see a different arrangement of these two forms marked
Aa.
with the letters Aa.
If you really wish to continue the pattern, certain irregularities must be
admitted, two decagons must be combined, two sides being removed from each
of them. As the pattern is continued outwardsfive-corneredforms appear repeatedly:
in the first and smallest of the five-cornered ranks there are five decagons with
no intermediate irregularity, in the second and wider rank lines of single decagons
lie between decagons joined in pairs, in the third rank the corners are taken
by pairs of joined decagons and between two such pairs there lies a simple decagon,
in the fourth rank^^ we again have simple decagons in the corners and on the
side between them there are two more decagons, spaced at equal intervals, in
the fifth rank the corners are marked by the tips of the outermost points of stars
and the sides each contain two simple decagons between which there are two
pairs of combined decagons. So as it progresses this five-cornered pattern con­
tinually introduces something new. The structure is very elaborate and intricate.
Aa.
See the diagram marked Aa.
Here we must also consider the star decagon, whose re-entrant angle fits
round the angle of a pentagon. In this way two of the points, each one three
tenths of a right angle, join up with two pentagon angles to fill the plane around
a point. This pattern takes in pentagons of a different size. It can be continued.

ut the continuation includes incomplete open decagons. The pattern is shown
marked with the letters Bb.
Bb.
We cannot take a single pentagon as one of the three plane figures which
are to form a congruence, for its angle is six fifths of a right angle, by XXXIII
of Book I, so the remaining two angles would be left with fourteen fifths of a
right angle, that is each would be seven fifths, which is not the angle of any
regular figure. Nor can we take two hexagons, for the remainder is also the angle
of a hexagon and we shall obtain theform of congruence already described above,
and we are now looking for structures involving two kinds offigure, not only
one kind. As for the higher polygons, whose angles are greater than that of the
hexagon, when two such angles are subtracted from four right angles the re­
mainder is less than the angle of a hexagon; taking one angle from four right
angles, what is left for the remaining two angles of the proposed congruence
is less than two hexagon angles. We have already dealt with those figures whose
angles are smaller than that of the hexagon, so we have dealt with all the ways
of covering the plane with three figures at each meeting-point.
X X Proposition
There are four ways in which the plane can be filled by the congruence
of plane angles of three kinds.
Here we cannot use three or more trigon angles at each meeting-point, for
three trigon angles make two right angles, and so leave a gap which is less than
the sum of the angles of the next two polygons, the tetragon and the pentagon.
For the same reason we cannot employ two trigon angles with two tetragon angles,
or with larger ones, since they do not leave enough space for the angle of the
third kind of figure.
1. So if we have two trigon angles and one tetragon angle, the dodecagon angle
will join up with them. However, this pattern cannot be continued. See letters
Cc, Dd, and Ee, which show three forms, all belonging to the first case of the
proposition.
Here, as above, we must consider the star dodecagon. For four trigon angles,
one tetragon angle and one point of the star will fill the plane. See forms F f
Gg, and Hh.
If a pentagon angle is joined up with two trigon angles the remainder will
be incongruent, being twenty-two twenty-fifths of a right angle, for there is no
angle of a regular figure which is eleven twenty-fifths. If one hexagon angle is
added to two trigon angles the remainder will also be a hexagon angle, and
the form will be one of those described above. So there are no more plane con­
gruences involving two trigons.
So let there be one trigon angle. Three tetragon angles cannot be added
to it, because then the sum is too large and there will not be enough space left
for the angle of the third kind.
2. To one trigon angle let us add two tetragon angles. When we subtract the
sum from four right angles the remainder is the angle of a hexagon. This pattern
takes two forms: the one shown at li can he continued, the one shown at Kk


cannot be continued without additional figures. This is the second case of the
proposition.
A single trigon angle cannot join up with two pentagon angles, because
the gap left is fourteen fifteenths of a right angle, an angle not found in regular
figures. Nor can a single trigon angle join up with one pentagon angle, because
the gap left would be thirty-two fifteenths of a right angle and no regular figure
has an angle of sixteen fifteenths. Nor can a trigon angle join up with one hexagon
angle, because they come to two right angles, and no single angle is that size;
and half of the gap is the size of the tetragon angle, which we have already
dealt with. Nor can a trigon angle join up with one angle of a heptagon or
of an octagon or of an enneagon, for the gap left for the third kind of angle
would beforty twenty-firsts of a right angle or eleven sixteenths or sixteen ninths,
none of which is the angle of a regular figure.
Now a trigon angle combined with a decagon angle leaves a gap of twenty-
six fifteenths of a right angle, which is the angle of the pentehaedecagon. These
figures do form a congruence, but a limited one. For the pentehaedecagon has
an odd number of sides, so by XVII the meeting-points at the angles of the figure
will not all be the same. Since the decagon has an even number of sides it can
be surrounded by alternate trigons and pentekaedecagons, but two of the
pentekaedecagons immediately run up against one another and prevent the pat­
tern from being continued.
Further, a trigon cannot be joined with a hendecagon, for this would leave
fifty-six thirty-thirds of a right angle, which is not the angle of any regular figure.
Next, a trigon angle taken together with a dodecagon angle leaves a gap
the size of a decagon angle, a form we have already discussed.
If a trigon angle is subtracted from four right angles, the space left is not
great enough to fit in angles of two other kinds, which together would come
to more than two right angles.

3. One tetragon angle joined up with one pentagon angle leaves a gap the size
of an icosigon angle. An icosigon can therefore fit together with two such angles
at every one of its own angles, forming a true congruence, but this pattern
cannot be continued outwards. It is therefore an imperfect congruence. See figure
Ll. This is the third case of the proposition.
4. A tetragon angle joined up with a hexagon angle leaves a gap the size of
a dodecagon angle. See figure Mm. This is the fourth and last case of the
proposition.
Here we must consider the star decagon which can be filled out with twelve
trigons. Four angles thus fit together to fill the space: two trigon angles, one
tetragon angle, one hexagon angle, and a point of the star. See figure Nn.
If a tetragon angle is added to a heptagon angle it leaves a gap of eleven
sevenths of a right angle, an angle not found in any regular figure. Added to
an octagon angle, a tetragon angle leaves a gap the size of an octagon angle.
We have discussed this form above. We have therefore dealt with all the cases
involving a tetragon angle.
A pentagon angle together with a hexagon angle leaves a gap of twenty-two
fifteenths of a right angle: taken together with a heptagon angle it leaves forty-eight thirty-fifths; with an octa^n angle thirteen tenths, while no such angle
is to be found in any regular figure. And now [taking a pentagon angle with
angles of figures having more sides than an octagon], the gap left starts to be
less than an octagon angle, which is fifteen tenths of a right angle. But we have
already dealt with congruences involving smaller angles. We have therefore dealt
with all the cases involving a pentagon angle.
Three hexagon angles fill the plane, so a hexagon angle cannot be combined
with two angles larger than itself. We have therefore dealt with all cases in­
volving figures of three different kinds.
