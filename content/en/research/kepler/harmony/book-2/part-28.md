## Proposition 18

XIII Archimedeans.

There are 13 solid congruences which are perfect in an inferior degree.

From these 13 we obtain the Archimedean solids.

For congruences in this degree figures of different kinds are combined, thus by proposition XXI either two or three kinds of figure will be involved. 

Cases involving 2 kinds either will or will not include trigons.

Thus, trigons and tetragons will make three solids which .satisfy definition

IX. This definition rules out three ways of constructing a solid angle, namely
by using one tetragon angle and either one or three trigon angles or by using
two tetragon angles and one trigon angle. For in the first case the congruence
includes only one tetragon and we obtain half an octahedron, a figure whose
solid angles are not all alike, while in the second case we have only two tetra­
gons^^ and in the third only two trigons.^^ So all these congruences are imper­
fect, by definition X. There remain the following methods of constructing a solid
angle from plane ones. First, by using four trigon angles and one tetragon angle.
For they add up to less than four right angles. Thus six tetragons and thirty-two
(that is twenty and twelve) trigons fit together to make a triacontaoctahedral
figure which I call a snub cube.^’^ It is shown in the diagram below, numbered
Oo.
I Snub cube.
12 .

Five trigon angles and one tetragon angle are more than four right angles, whereas to form a solid angle they would need to be less than four right angles, by Part 16.

The same is true of four trigon angles and two tetragon angles. In fact, three trigon angles and two tetragon angles make four right angles. 

Second, two trigon angles and two tetragon angles are less than four right
angles. Thus eight trigons and six tetragons fit together to form a tessareshae-
decahedron, which I call a cuboctahedron.^^ It is shown here with the number
eight. Two trigon angles and three tetragon angles are more than four right angles.
Third, one trigon angle and three tetragon angles come to less than four
right angles. Therefore eight triangles and eighteen (that is, twelve and six)
squares join up to make an icosihexahedron, which I call a truncated cuboctahedral rhombus or a rhombicuboctahedron.^^ It is shown on this page, numbered 10.
