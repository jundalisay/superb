Explanation of Order

We have set out the harmonic proportions, considered in the abstract,
in the first three books, of which the first exhibited the geometrical
properties of the individual figures, the second their congruences in
combination, and the third developed the harmonic proportions from
the figures.
It remained for us to apply the harmonies, which we have hitherto
described, to the cosmos, in three other books, of which the first would
attribute the harmonies to God the Creator of the heavens, the second
to Nature the director of the differing motions, and the third to Man
the controller of his voice, which originates from motion. However,
the requirements of stating the arguments have persuaded us not only
to reverse the order, starting from human song, passing from that to
the works of Nature, and thus finally to the work of Creation, which
was the first and most perfect of all, but also to combine the end of
abstract speculation with the beginning of actual harmonies in mel­
ody, in the same third book. Therefore, after starting this application
to the cosmos in the preceding book, and transferring the harmonies
to human melody, which others usually embrace in the general term
Art, there now follows the fourth book, which in this reverse order
attributes to Nature the second part in actual harmony.
Although indeed I touched on the discussion of the essence of
the harmonies here and there in Book III, nevertheless with the same
intention I decided that the full treatment of this metaphysical dis­
cussion should be reserved for the beginning of this fourth Book. For
since the philosophers commonly look for harmonies nowhere else
but in melody, and since for many people it is an unexpected treat
when they are told that sounds are something different from the har­
monies which are thought to be in the sounds,something had to be
conceded to the weakness of our understanding, and the origin of
the harmonies had to be explained by the terms which are commonly
known to musicians: the eagerness of the reader had not to be disturbed
by the uncomfortable subtlety of metaphysical investigations.
But now my intention is furthermore to reveal the harmonies in
Nature and in the motions of the heavens. Indeed the common herd
of philosophers at the first mention of harmony immediately conceives the singing music of the stars, which can be perceived by the hearing;
and along with Cicero’s Scipio stands with its ears pricked to catch
“so great and so sweet a sound.” It is easy for those who are inexperi­
enced in these matters to conclude with Cicero the dreamer himself
that “Motions so great cannot rush on in silence,” and with the Pythag­
oreans according to Aristotle give an explanation why the sound of
the heavens is not heard upon earth.’ These preconceived opinions
are a considerable obstacle to readers who are striving towards the
inner secrets of Nature, and could frighten off many who have great
powers of judgement and are seekers after truth, to such an extent
that they would disdain those Pythagorean pipedreams, scarcely rec­
ognized at arm’s length, and throw away the book unread. For these
reasons this seemed to me a suitable place to assign to this highly
necessary discussion.
I was also moved by the example of Ptolemy.^ When in the first
two books of his work on Harmony he had completed the exposition
of the harmony which concerns melody, and had already embarked
in the third book on his demonstration that all perfect natures par­
ticipate in the force of harmony,he too began his examination with
this same question “To what class of things should the nature or force
of harmony, and the knowledge of it, be assigned?” Therefore, although
I have relegated examination and judgment of Ptolemy to the appen­
dix of this work of mine, yet for the reason stated the reply which it
seems ought to be made in accordance with my basic principles to
this question of Ptolemy’s had to be placed at the start of this fourth
Book. Nor does that relate only to forearming the reader and avoid­
ing adverse opinions, but also to the fundamental theme of Book 4..


Hence, because we are going to state of the harmonies
of the stellar rays-’ what they are and how many they are in number,
and on what geometrical principles they are formed, we should first
know what the essence of the harmonies is, apart from consideration
either of sounds, which are here of no importance, or even of the rays
themselves, what their proper subject and their terms are, whether
they are among those things which are outside our understanding,
or only in our soul, by what medium they are perceived, and inwardly
received, by what agency they are discriminated, and what effect fol­
lows this perception and recognition, by what originator or prime mover.
When these points have been explained, both generally and by the
comparison of particular features, it will then be easy for us to discuss
metaphysically the essence and properties of minds and of sublunary
nature itself, and to show the secrets of Nature in rather clearer light
than hitherto.
