## Proposition I

The affinity between the rays and a circle and its arcs is greater than was that between the consonances.
The bases of what was previously stated in Book HI were already justifiably taken over into Book IV as an axiom. However, it is proved as follows:

1. Consonances are between sounds; sounds consist in motions;
their heights or depths in pitch,
by which the consonances are ex­
pressed, arise from the speed and
slowness of the motions, by what
has been demonstrated in Book
III. 

But the quick and slow sounds are elicited from the striking of
strings which are stretched, not
only if the stretching is in a circle,
but also, and much more, if it is
in a straight line. Therefore, the
consonances do not relate imme- iately to the circle and its arcs,
on account of their circular shape,
but on account of the length of
Figure
their parts, that is their mutual
proportion; and they have what
they have from the circle even
when the circle has been destroyed
and stretched out into a straight
line. Aspects on the contrary are
by Definition I angles, which the
circle measures along with its arcs
only if it remains what it is said
to be, that is insofar as it both
has its circular shape and retains
it completely

2. The consonances were not all propagated with an equnlly close relation­
ship to the circle and its parts; for some of them related their origin to parts
of the circle, insofar as they had some property not as parts of the circle but
as straight lines, that is the same division as the whole circle, as was shown
in Book III. It is the opposite in the case of the aspects; for the measure of what
corresponds with the circle cannot in any way be related to straightness.^"^

IV.

## Proposition 2

The affinity between the rays and the regular figures is greater than was that of the consonances.
It is proved first by the figure at the circumference. 

For where the circle is complete, in that case the regular figure is also complete. 

But the circle is more complete in measuring the
angles of rays, by I. 

Then the figure also can be considered more as com­
plete in relation to the rays. 

It is the opposite in the case of consonances: as the circle and its parts could be
stretched out straight, while preserving the consonances, so also all the
sides of a figure could be stretched out into one and the same straight line, and could make a consonance with
one straight side of the figure. On that basis, indeed, just as the circle loses
its configuration, so also does the recti­
linear figure, so that it is no longer
a figure.
It is proved second by the figure
at the center. Angles are the elements
of figures. In this case two rays make
the angle at the center; and if that
is repeated a certain number of times
it completes the figure, as is apparent
from these diagrams. However, that
was not the case with the origin of
the consonances: for there was no re­
lationship with the angle at the center
in that case. Therefore, thefigures are
more closely akin to the aspects than to the consonances.
Proposition III
The congruence of figures is capable of more in establishing influ­
ential configurations than in the case of consonances.
Many arguments for this point are forthcoming. 1. Congruence is a prop­
erty of a figure insofar as it is a whole figure and has an appearance. But a
figure, insofar as the whole of it has this appearance, first, in itself on its own
account has more affinity with configurations than with consonances, by Prop­
osition II. Second, it divides the circle as a whole harmonically; but the circle
also has more affinity with configurations than with consonances, by Proposi­
tion I. Hence on both showings, on that of the figure independently and that
of the figure and the circle in common, the force of the congruence of figures
is also greater in configurations than in consonances.
2. From the number of figures. For we have taken it, on account of the
axioms previously stated, that figures are influential on account of their prop­
erties. Then where the number of the
things influenced corresponds more,
there is a greater affinity between cause
and effect, at least probably. But as
the congruent figures are few, so also
the aspects are few, as experience testi­
fies. For if they were not few, there
would be a great confusion of them,
and a great multitude, so that indi­
vidual aspects could not be observed
separately on their own days. But they
can be observed: therefore, they are
not infinite in number. On the con­
trary, the consonances can be infinite,
by augmentation of the intervals by diapasons, just as the knowablefigures
are infinite.
3. From the essence of the terms,
in which the proportions in either di­
rection have their existence. Motions,
of which sounds are a disposition, are
considered as Becoming, insofar as
they take time; radiations more as in­
stantaneous Being. For just as a body
exists at this moment, so also a ra­
diation exists at this moment; whereas
of motion what has passed no longer
is, what follows is not yet, in a mo­
ment it is nothing. Congruence, how­
ever, seems to be among things which
are, rather than among those which become. For the sides or wall of a house
are congruent so that the house may exist, not so that now and perpetually
it may be built.
4. From the affinity of congruence, as cause, with configurations. For the
latter are angles; but congruence also exists in figures on account of their
angles.
So far consonances and configurations have been opposite to each
other. In what follows there will be another opposition among configu­
rations alone, between congruence and knowability.
Proposition IV
The congruence of figures is capable of making configurations influ­
ential more than knowability.
It is proved from the circumstances of the sublunary Soul and also of the
faculties of the human soul which perceive the aspects. These, then, are all in­
ferior to the contemplative faculty and the understanding; and they have closer
affinity with the sensitive faculty and the one which controls the operations
of the senses. Indeed, the instinct of the former, as we have stated in Chapter
III, is as much duller than the human instinct as the body of the Earth is cruder
than the body of Man. But congruence is later in order than knowability, and
is, as it were, presented outwards to some operation which has the idea of the
operations of the senses. It is therefore right for it to be believed that these animal
faculties are moved and affected by congruence rather than by the knowability
of the figures.
Congruence and knowability were therefore opposites in the same
kind of configuration. Now two figures will be opposed to each other,
first with reference to congruence alone, after that with reference to
configurations. 

Proposition V
Congruence is a property of the figure at the circumference rather
than at the center?^
For it has the more important position in the figure which can be whole,
on account of the position from which it takes its name, because congruence
belongs to whole figures, as is apparent from Book II. But of the central figure
not more than one angle can stand at the center, by Definition I. However, at
the circumference the whole of the circumferential figure can exist. The prop­
osition follows.
Proposition VI
Of the two figures which each aspect claims for itself, that at the cir­
cumference is more important than that at the center.
For congruence is more important in this business than knowability, by
IV. But congruence is more important in the figure at the circumference, by
V. Hence, that which has superior power also makes the very thing in which it
is have superior power, that is to say the figure at the circumference.
The same is also proved in the
following way from the inmost prop­
erties of the soul, touched on in
Chapter III. For as it is the soul which
adapts its own formal essence to the
harmonies of the configurations, cer­
tainly by the same distinction by which
the soul is either a circle,^^ or a point
which is the center of a circle, so also
will the figures which belong to its
household, those at the circumference
and at the center, be distinguished.
In fact, every soul bears some idea
of a circle, in fact of a circle abstracted 


not only from matter but also in a
sense from magnitude, as was stated
in Chapter III, and so the circle and
its center in this case almost coincide,
and the soul is either a potential circle
or a point in which directions are dis­
tinguished, and thus it can be said
in a sense to have qualities. Yet it seems
that the division must be observed be­
tween those faculties of the soul which
should be considered rather as a cir­
cle, and those which should be consid­
ered rather as a point. For just as
a circle cannot be imagined without
a center, and on the other hand every
point has round it space for drawing a circle, so also in the case of the soul
there is no operation without an image-forming impression, and on the other
hand every internal reception or meditation is on account of an external motion,
and very interior faculty of the mind
is on account of those which are rather
exterior. What is the chief and supreme
faculty of the soul, called the mind,
if not a center"? What is the reason­
ing faculty if not a circle? For just
as the center is inside, and the circle
more outside, so the mind keeps itself
to itself, and reasoning weaves a sort
of exterior web; and just as the center
is the basis, source, and origin of a
circle, so the mind is of reasoning.
Again, every such faculty of the soul,
both the understanding, the contem­
plative, and indeed the sensitive fac­
ulty, are a sort of center. But the
faculties of the soul which produce
motion are a circle, because again, as
a circle on the outside is placed about
its center, so operation is towards the
outside, and cognition and meditation
are performed within; and as a circle
is to a point, so in a way external ac­
tion is to internal contemplation, ani­
mate motion to sensation. For a point,
because it is opposite to the circum­
ference in all directions, is born suit­
able for representing passive experi­
ence; andfor what is the sensitive soul. 

even as in this case when it is that which perceives radiations, except for sensing
and perceiving what it experiences passively^ That is, because it is moved by
its objects.
Also by comparing each point of comparison: as the center is the same in
either case, so also the form of cognition is in a way the same, the chief mental
one, and the sensitive, or, analogous to it, that which perceives radiations: neither
uses contemplation in itself, insofar as it is what it is, but it recognizes without
contemplation. Hence, as the former, I mean sublunary Nature or even the sensi­
tive faculty, is a sort of faint image of the latter, the chieffaculty of the human
mind, so the former, contemplation by the reason, is an image of these actions
and operations of the soul, a circle in each case.
Therefore, insofar as souls perceive celestial radiations, and so are to speak
moved within themselves by them, let them be for us points; but on the other
hand insofar as they are movers, that is, insofar as they transfer perceived har­
monies between the radiations into their own operations, and are stimulated
by them to action, they should be considered as circle.
It therefore follows that to the extent to which it is recognizing the har­
monies of the rays, it is concerned chiefly with the central figure; whereas to
the extent to which it is operating, arousing occurrences in the sky (and similar
ones in Man), it fits itself to the one at the circumference. And in fact in the
case of an aspect, we give prior concern for its influence than for the means
by which it is perceived by the operative soul, and therefore, also prior attention
to the figure at the circumference rather than to the figure at the center.
In this case, figure was compared with figure in one and the same
aspect. In the following couple, supposing the figure is the same, its
congruence will be opposed to its knowability.
Proposition VII
In the figure at the circumference, congruence takes precedence over
the knowability of the side. In the figure at the center on the other
hand, the knowability of the side takes precedence over the congru­
ence of the figure.
This proposition pertains to the completion of the matter which was left
half finished in Proposition III. For although congruence is more important
in IV than in III, constructibility was also more important in Book III. Yet
this should not be completely separated from the constitution of the aspects,
since no congruence is without a knowledge-producing construction; and on
it depends that of both the side and particularly of the area bounded by the
sides of the figure. For it is from the angles, in which suitability for congruence
resides, that the construction is derived.
It seems, therefore, that as far as this proposition is concerned its contrary
is true, both in the one case and in the other. For as far as the figure at the
center is concerned, one angle of it has in actual fact been expressed through
the rays; but of the figure at the circumference no angle is expressed, but only
its side, up to a point. However, congruence belongs to angles. Therefore, it seems
that we must take most notice of that in the central figure. For if sublunary 

Nature perceives the quantity of an angle, which two rays form at the Earth,
it seems that it can also perceive the fitness of that angle, along with the others,
for congruence.
The fact that on the other hand we should take more notice in the figure
at the circumference of the knowability of its side than of its congruence seems
evident from the following. For the knowledge by which a figure is known, as
was demonstrated in Book I, is based on the equality either of a side to an ex­
pressible part of the diameter, or of the square of a side to an expressible part
of the square of the diameter, or of the area of thefigure to the same, or on another
linkage of either the side, or of its square and area, to the diameter or its square,
or determination by it. Suppose, therefore, that sublunary Nature has sensation
of the zodiac circle, a circle which is of course sensible, and stands outside it,
which it examines against the idea of an abstract intellectual circle, which it
has within itself and born or created along with itself. In that case it certainly
follows that in the natural order it first senses the size of the arc of the zodiac
marked off between two planets, the size of the chord which it subtends, its kind,
whether it is expressible in length or only in square, whether it makes an ex­
pressible sum of squares in combination with any other, and an expressible rec­
tangle, and on what property the expressibility of its area is founded. These
things, I say, seem to become known to sublunary Nature first in the natural
order, because a side is prior to a figure which is described by a repetition of
the side; and it is only afterwards when the whole figure has been described
on the zodiac circle, that the angles become evident, and their quantity, and
whether they are among the congruent, and whether the figure converges with
all its angles to the same kind of congruence, or whether the congruence is con­
tinuous. In short, congruence is a feature of angles, knowability of sides. There­
fore, when the angle of a figure becomes known before its side, in that case the
parts of congruence seem to be earlier and more important than those of know-
ability; when it is known after, they are later. But it is the angle of the figure
which reaches the center which becomes known first, whereas the side of the
figure described at the surface (I mean between only two planets) becomes known
first. Therefore, it seems to be right if in the figure at the center consideration
of congruence is held to be more important, but in that at the surface that of
knowability.
We must therefore rebut these points which have been adduced to support
the contrary of our proposition, and in the same operation we must reinforce
by true arguments the order of the properties of congruence and knowability.
First, then, although it is true in respect of the central figure that one angle
is formed by the rays of two planets, yet it does not follow from that that the
mind when it perceives the quantity of the angle perceives first in the natural
order the congruence of the figure to which the angle is going to belong. The
reason is evident, that congruence, insofar as it belongs to one angle, and several
equal to it, placed in a single plane, is too general. For there are infinite forms
of angles which are congruent in that way, and they are always greater in number
in proportion as the individual angles are smaller. This, then, is not the con­
gruence which we discuss in Book II which is a property not of angles individually but of complete figures on account of their angles, and not of single figures but of several in combination.

Thus, the objection is not only rebutted but turned against itself For the assumption it had made about the figure at the circumference, we can with equal justice make about that at the center, that congruence, as was stated in our
proposition here, is in it later than knowability, so that the part it plays ought
to be more important than that of the former, by our adversary’s own admission.
For a figure must come into being before the whole of it can be congruent. 

However, in this instance unless the side of the figure is knowable, the figure cannot come into being. For although it is true that if in a figure one angle is given, which the rays of two planets form at the center, the number of all of them is
given, and through them the fitness of the whole figure for congruence, and the
nature of the side does not enter into this demonstration, yet that one angle
of the figure is not given, that is, it is not recognized as an angle of a congruent
figure, except through a knowable side. 

Therefore, the soul knows the side before (in natural order) it recognizes that it is given a congruent angle.
But if we Compare both figures in this case, the side or area of the figure
center is given less, in fact, by the actual radiation, than the side of the
figure at the circumference. For the latter is always bounded by the actual rays,
the latter not always, but only in certain figures, as in the triangle, because
the individual sides of the angle at the circumference subtend an arc equal to
the intercept. Therefore, the figure at the center is more remote from the act
of knowing than that at the circumference. Therefore, the recognition of con­
gruence is also more remote. However, the objection rested on the contrary, as
if the congruence of that at the center was more accessible to recognition than
the congruence of that at the circumference.
Further, if the quantity of the angle is perceived, by what will it be perceived
if not by its own measure, that is, by the arc of that circle which is drawn from
the point of the angle in question, that is the Earth? But not at first by an
arc of that circle which is drawn round the central figure, and which passes
through the Earth. Hence in the perception of the quantity of an angle in the
central figure, it must as a soul show that power by which it is a circle, not
that by which it is a tiny point, to which the angle extends. But by the same
character of its circular essence it also perceives the side of the figure at the
circumference, and its arc, and that at first. Only after that, with the doubling
of this arc, does the arc of the smaller circle also emerge, which is drawn round
the central figure, and passes through the center of the previous one. This arc
assists the inscription of thefigure at the center in the circle. For the order which
occurs in reasoning is also the same in instinct. Again, then, a way is demon­
strated to the perception of the central figure, a longer way, and so also to its
congruence. Hence the objection reverses itself, as it based its superior force on
priority in perception.
To the reasoning for the other branch of the argument the following reply
has to be made. In fact even in the figure at the circumference the knowability
of the side is in truth prior to the congruence of the whole figure, on account
of the arguments stated, which are also valid in this case. But it does not follow
that of two things, one of which is the cause of the other, the one which is the cause also in addition moves a third one more strongly. For in relation to the
grasp of the soul, which has to be moved, often for that purpose the cause has
less force than the effect. So in this case the sublunary Soul, insofar as it is
indeed perceptive, is more moved by the knowability of the figure at the center;
whereas insofar as it is operative, it is more moved by the congruence of the
figure at the circumference.
However, my own arguments to prove the proposition are the following. We
first took it in Proposition VI that the center is a sort of idea of the speculative
mind, or understanding, the circumference of the practical or operative faculty,
because as the center is the basis and origin of a circle, so meditation is of action.
Then the figure which offers its angle to the center, that is to the Earth, where
the soul, the perceiver of the figure, has its seat, offers itself, so to speak, for
knowing and judging, since the center represents the judgment seat of knowledge.
Therefore, in the figure at the center more notice should be taken of knowledge,
notwithstanding the fact that it is obtained by means of the circle as if by an
instrument, as was stated a little earlier.
On the other hand, thefigure which arranges the angles at the circumference
applies itself more to imitation and to expression in the operation of the soul,
as if working towards the idea of the operations. But it is congruence rather
than knowability which has the idea of sensible operations and constructions,
because it is a consequence of whole figures, while the side by which the figure
is known is merely an element of it. Hence in the figure at the circumference
we must have regard to congruence rather than to knowability.
Another argument for this second part depends on the same consideration
of the soul. It prevails on account of what the others are. But configurations
are perceived on account of the operation of sublunary Nature, and indeed of
the inferior faculties of the human soul. That is to say, they are perceived for
the purpose of expressing them operationally. The status of the motor faculty
is therefore greater in this business. But the knowability of the figure at the
circumference assists perception, and its congruence assists operation, as hitherto.
Therefore, the congruence of the figure at the circumference also prevails over
the knowability of the same.
Proposition VHP®
The arc of a circle which is established by an incongruent figure im­
parts no influence to the rays of two planets which delimit the arc.
For if congruence is the most important cause of influence, by Propositions
III, IV, and VII, therefore if that is lacking, knowability will not be sufficient as
a more humble substitute cause. For although the latter is more powerful than
congruence in the figure at the center, by the other part of Proposition VII, yet
on the other hand the figure at the circumference is more important than the one at the center, by VI. And in that congruence is more powerful, by the first
part of Proposition VII. Therefore, the congruence of the figure at the circum­
ference is still more powerful than the knowability of the figure at the center.
See, here is the reason why, whereas the knowable figures are infin­
ite, and indeed of various degrees, the aspects, however, are few.
Axiom III
The arcs of a circle, of which the figures are powerful in more, and
more important, degrees of congruence and knowability, also take the
more influential configurations.
If the first two axioms are generally agreed,so will this be, because on
account of the fact that every individual one is like that, if the former is in­
tensified, the latter will also be more like that. Understand this, however, in
the following way: that in the figure at the circumference the comparison of
the degrees of congruence takes precedence, in that at the center comparison
of the degrees of knowability, and in fact the part of the figure at the circum­
ference is more important.
Proposition IX
The influential configurations are those which intercept the following
arcs of the zodiac circle:
180°: opposition
from the diameter of the circle, as in Figure I.
90°: the quartile □ from the tetragon, as in Figure II.
120°: the trine A , and 60°: the sextile )(, from the triangle and
the hexagon, as in Figures III and IV.
45°: the octile or semiquartile, and 135°: the trioctile or quartile-
and-a-half
from the octagon and its star, as in Figures V and VI.
30°: the semisextile H, and 150°: the quincunx (five-twelfths), from
the dodecagon and its star, as in Figures VII and VIII.
72°: the quintile
and 108°: the tridecile or quintile-and-a-half,
from the pentagon and the decagonal star, as in Figures IX and X.
144°: the biquintile
and 36°: the half-quintile or decile, from
the pentagonal star and the decagon, as in Figures XI and XII.
That thesefigures are knowable and constructible has been shown in Book I:
that they are also congruent, in Book II. However, that the configurations of arcs
expressed by such are influential is in the Axioms I and II previously stated.


Proposition X

The influentiality of the aspects the first and strongest degree is that of conjunction and opposition
For in conjunction the two rays are congruent on the same line, and descend from the same side: in opposition ^
they descend from different sides indeed, but are nonetheless parts of one
continuous line. 

This in fact is the most perfect congruence and a kind of basic principle of all congruence.
Thus as conjunction is represented by a point marked on the circumference of the circle, but opposition by
the diameter, these are certainly basic principles. 

The former is also the measure of all knowledge in this class, as all knowledge of a straight line in a
circle is contained in the constrmtible demarcation of it by means of the
length or square of the diameter, as was made clear in Book I. Therefore,
entiality is also in these aspects.


## Proposition 11

The second degree of influentiality of aspects is that of the quartile □ .

For in the quartile many privileges coincide, the first of which is that the figure at its center is similar to that at its circumference. 

Hence whatever degrees it holds in congruence and knowability are understood to be in a sense double relatively to the other aspects. For just as the quartile is the first, after opposition, to be unfolded from the narrowness of its line to some breadth or surface extension of its tetragonal area,^^ so the remaining aspects descend from the
identity of the figures of the quartile aspect to some difference in their figures.

Therefore, as elsewhere in natural philosophy, excellence which is unified is stronger, in this ideal and objective portrayal the degree of strength will be greater where figures in distinct positions, that is one at the center and one at the circumference, are found to be the same in kind.

Second, as far as congruence is concerned, in the square it is most perfect and of all kinds, for this figure is itself congruent with itself in the solid to form a cube, which is the measure of all solidity; and is congruent in the simplest
way, taking in only three angles; and is itself congruent with itself in the plane,
with four angles. Again, it is congruent in the solid with the triangle, pentcigon.

hexagon, octagon, and decagon in
different ways, to form solid figures;
and is congruent with all of those, and
in addition with the dodecagon, and
the icosagon to a certain extent, to lay
out a flat surface. In this property it
is surpassed by no other.
Third, the area of the square is
expressible, which is the basic prin­
ciple of a certain singular and out­
standing congruence in the plane, so
that a definite number of areas of this
figure take up a definite number of
squares on the diameter, and thus the
figures are not only in themselves congruent with each other in their angles
and sides, but in a way, that is in definite lines of theirs, also with the sides
of the square on the diameter. This property the quartile aspect shares partly
with the half-sextile alone. See Book II.
Fourth, the degree of knowledge of the side is also not ignoble, as it is ex­
pressible in the square. In this degree it is pre-eminent over all the other figures,
except the hexagon. However, it does not on that account give way to it, since
knowability is not to be compared with congruence, as has been explained above,
and indeed the accumulation of privileges is valid for increasing the influence,
by Axiom III of this Chapter.
Proposition XII
The third degree of influentiality is that of the trine A , sextile % and
semi-sextile
That I place the trine, sextile, and half sixth in the same degree is not due
to identity of properties but to equal power. First, their principal figures trans­
mit shared operations to congruent
planes; for they meet each other, and
others, such as the square, in various
ways. In fact, the triangle and hexa­
gon are pre-eminent in this case, be­
cause the individual kinds are con­
gruent also with themselves. The
hexagon is pre-eminent over the tri­
angle, because it holds the most per­
fect congruence in the plane, that is
in its three angles alone. Both are pre­
eminent over the dodecagon, because
they are congruent with other figures
even in the solid, which the dodeca­
gon cannot be. Yet on the other hand the dodecagon is pre-eminent over the others in the expressibility of its area,
whereas their areas are medial^^^ and so more ignoble. This difference between
the areas, as I stated just now, re­
dounds to the perfection of its congru­
ence. Similarly the triangle also is
again pre-eminent over the hexagon,
in that the triangular kind is itself
congruent with itself in the solid in­
various ways, and begets three regu­
lar solids: the hexagon is congruent
only with other figures. Thus on ba­
lancing the weights of the different
properties against each other, congru­
ence, which is the first and chief ele­
ment in influence, in the case of these
three very nearly produces equilibri­
um. In knowability the hexagon holds
first place, as its side is expressible;
second place is held by the triangle, for it takes the same degree as the tetragon,
having its side expressible in the square, but in a more humble proportion. The
dodecagon is last in this instance, having an inexpressible side. However, know-
ability is not the chief indication of influence, and is not considered in the most
important figure, that is the one at the circumference, but only in the one at
the center which is less important. If
it has any effect, it renders the trine
a little more influential than the sex­
tile, because the trine is formed by an
angle of the hexagon at the center, and
the half-sixth a little less influential
than either, as it is measured out by
an angle of the dodecagonal star at
the center. However, knowledge of the
half-sixth is more noble than the rest
which follow, because the side of the
figure at its center is of the most noble
kind among the inexpressible, that is
the binomial,^^ and in their twofold
subdivision it always holds the supe­
rior place, to the extent that along with
its partner the side of the figure at the circumference it forms an expressible
triangle. That is the mark of almost absolute perfection, and also in fact makes
this figure in knowability a contender with the triangle and the hexagon, be­
cause it weighs in the balance against its inexpressibility, very heavily. 

## Proposition 13

The fourth degree of the configurations in influentiality is that of the quintile, biquintile, and quincunx.

For these have in common congruence of the whole of the primary figures in the plane, though not of
the individual kinds each with it self, but of the first two figures mu­
tually with each other, and of the last with the others which are akin
to it. 

The first two aspects are preeminent in virtue of the fact that their figures, the pentagon and its
star, are congruent in the solid as well, and make two regular solid
figures. 

By this nobility they almost bring their aspects to the level of the
trine and quadrant. 

The dodecagonal star is not congruent in the solid. Yet on the otherhand the do-
decagonal star is also pre-eminent by its plane congruence, which in
it is capable of being continued to infinity, whereas the former figures
cannot be continuedfar without an admixture of irregularity. See all this
in Book 2. 

As far as the knowability of the sides in the figures at the centers is
concerned, here also the sides of the decagon, tridecile, and dodecagon
stand in the middle position, and they are central in this class, between
the side of the triangle which precedes and the sides of the pentagon
and the pentagonal star which are the central figures in the following
class. 

For it was demonstrated in Book I that in knowledge the dodecagon’s side takes precedence
over the pentagon’s, the tridecile’s
over the pentagonal star’s. Thus
knowability leads in the same direction as congruence too, by Proposition 7. 

This had to be stated in advance, chiefly for the sake of this demonstration, in case the decile or tridecile should be given preference over the quintile and biquintile. 

If, however, someone should wish to dismiss thefigure at the center and seek knowability rather in the one at the circumference, no less than congruence, although it must be admitted that on that basis the decile would be preferred to the quintile, and the tridecile to the biquintile, he should nevertheless remember that the parts of congruence are the most important, as we have shown in Proposition IV. Therefore, it is a greater thing, and has more effect on influentiality, to create a solid figure (which is like a sort of mathematical idea of physical influentiality) than to have a side which is knowable in a more perfect degree. 

The side of the dodecagon indeed on this basis brings its aspect into the same class as the chords subtended by a tenth part of a circle, and by three tenths, because they contend with each other for pre-eminence in knowability. For just as those two chords are associated with each other, and the smaller is part of the greater in the divine proportion of the extreme and
mean, so also the side of the dodecagon and the side of its star are associated,
and that in respect of a division and combination, though not proportional.
And in fact this latter pair falls into the first kind of inexpressibles, which em­
braces the binomials and apotomes; but on the other hand the former pair ac­
quires a new property of division according to extreme and mean, as may be
seen in Book I. Hence these degrees are not just balanced, but the side of the
decagon even has a little the better of it. It was therefore correctly done that
I placed the aspect of the quincunx, or 150, in the same degree as the quintile,
72, and the biquintile, 144, though giving the chief seat to these last.


## Proposition 14

The fifth, lowest, and feeblest degree of the aspects is that of the decile and the tridecile, the octile, and the trioctile. 

I have made the fifth place for the decile and the tridecile (Maestlin calls them the half-quintile and the quintile -and-a-half) which until now I left out in the Ephemerides. 

With them 1 have associated the octile and trioctile, or half-quadrant and quadrant-and-a-half which the compilers of almanacs, at my suggestion indeed and to a large extent on the authority of Ptolemy,
have seized on, but with too much enthusiasm and too little consideration.

Therefore, both points must be tested, first that these 4 are feebler than the quintile and biquin­
tile, and second that the decile and tridecile are stronger than the octile
and trioctile, by a very little. 

Since, then, our propositions place the greatest weight for determining influence on the congruence
of the chief figure, that is the one at the circumference, it is evident 

that the pentagon and its star are congruent each with the figures of its own
kind, to form a perfect solid, as has just been stated, and are also splendidly
congruent with each other to lay out a plane. On the other hand, the decagon
and the octagon along with their stars cannot be congruent in the solid, each
with the others of its own kind. In­
deed, the decagon and the octagon
are congruent, but with others which
are not all of their own kind. The
stars in fact start on a certain con­
gruence in the solid but do not com­
plete it. Even in the plane their con­
gruence is more ignoble, because they
do not deliver shared operations,
each independently with its ozvn star,
as the pentagon does with its own;
but with those stars of their own,
and the octagon with the tetragon,
they come into partnership in an
alien congruence, and the decagon
itself prevents the possibility of that’s being continued. Its star also produces
a split congruence in the intermediate spaces which are intercepted. However,
the octagon and its star rejoice in an alternating continuation of congruence,
with an admixture of squares. The congruence occurs in a variety offorms. Thus
these four are almost on a par in
plane congruence, especially as each
set of figures has inexpressible areas.
But in knowability the pentagonal
group is greatly pre-eminent. First,
if we were to consider the figures at
the center, which in this case are in
fact the pentagon and its star, their
sides indeed fall under the same class
of inexpressibles as the sides of the
octagon and its star, being elasson
and mizon.

But if we consider the figures at the circumferences, which
in this case are the sides of the deca­
gon and its star, these are not onlyfrom the nobler kind of binomials and apotomes,
whereas the octagons lines are from the fourth kind, which is that of the mizons
and elassons, but also all the sides of the pentagonal group acquire the noblest
property of division in the proportion of extreme and mean, which clearly does
not apply at all to the octagons lines. But if the octagonal group seemed to be
somewhat pre-eminent in congruence, in this case on the other hand it is much
more strongly pushed down by the pentagonal group. I was therefore right to
