EFFECT ON EVENTS IN THE SKY
AND OTHER NATURAL PHENOMENA.'
Proclus Diadochus, Commentaries on Euclid I, Book
On the use of mathematics in Natural Philosophy and Politics,
which most of all concern the Harmonic part of it on radiations.
It furnishes everything that is important for the contemplation
of nature, declaring the most splendid order of the ratios, according
to which the whole of this universe has been constructed, and the anal足
ogy of the proportions, which connects together everything in the world,
as Timaeus^ says somewhere, and which restores friendship between
things which are in conflict, and relations and mutual affection be足
tween those which are widely separated.
And a little later. Hence it is also possible to hunt out by logical
thinking the appropriate pattern of angles.
Again. In my opinion this is also what Timaeus^ meant, when he
everywhere describes his reflections on the nature of the whole uni足
verse in mathematical terms, depicts the origin of the elements in
numbers and figures, and states that their powers and properties, and
their effects, were taken from these {figures), the acute and obtuse among
the angles, and the rough and smooth among the sides, and so forth,
establishing the causes of all kinds of mutations.
Indeed on the study of Politics, as it is called, how could it be denied
that mathematics confers very many remarkable benefits, as it mea足
sures out the proper occasions for conducting affairs, and the various
revolutions in the whole of the universe, etc., and the Harmonic
Numbers, which control life or are responsible for incongruence, and
universally give support to hastening or slackening of motions, etc
