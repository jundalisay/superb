On the Essence of the Harmonic Proportions,
Both Sensible and Intelligible.
Being on the point of examining the essence of the harmonies, I find
myself in doubt whether it will be clearer to seek out the opinions
of the ancients first, and then to compare them with mine, or to start
by expounding my own opinion. The former method in philosophy
is accepted by everyone, and is frequently recommended by Aristotle:
the latter seems more suitable for the matter in hand. For few have
attempted to examine the nature of the harmonies as a class; and if
anything has been said on the substance of the mathematical types
and classes, whatever can be applied to the harmonies as a class must
necessarily in the philosophy of the Gentiles be full of obscurity, and
on that account the mind of the reader must be tossed with doubt
between love for such pretty theories and suspicion of falsehood. In
the company of Christians, and for anyone who embraces with a firm
faith the sacrosanct mystery of the Trinity and the origin of all things
in the Mosaic story, the heads of the examination can both be ex­
pounded more clearly, and find the minds of readers more inclined
to believe them. Therefore, to organize the procedure for stating them,
we shall have to start with the classification. For sensible harmony,
or things which are analogous to it,is one thing, harmony which is
apart from and purified of sensible things is another. The former are
many, both in respect of their subjects, which are different in kind,
and individually; but genuine harmony which is apart from sensible
subjects is one and the same in whatever kind. For instance, the har­
mony which arises from double proportion is one and the same kind.
If it is in sounds, it is called a diapason; if in r a d ia tio n ,it is named
the aspect of opposition; and in the musical system indeed it is either
further up or down, it is either higher or lower in pitch, it is either in
human voices or in sounds from instruments. Nor is it less various
in the study of the heavens, for it is the same whether it belongs to
Saturn andjupiter or to another couple, whether it is among the signs
round the equinoxes or those near the solstices.
On each kind of harmony, therefore, the question is, what is their
basis, each in its own right, whether that basis is in themselves or in
other things. As far as sensible harmonies are concerned, then, the
following four features are involved in their essence: I. Two sensible
things of the same kind, and of a certain size, so that they can be com pared with each other in respect of size. 2. The soul which compares
them. 3. The reception of the sensible things within [the soul]. 4. An
appropriate proportion, which is defined as a harmony. If one of these
is taken away, the sensible harmony is taken away. For it is easy to under­
stand that the nature of harmony is not to be defined by means of
sensible things alone, such as a sound or a ray from a star. For a sound
is one thing: a definite order among different sounds is another. Now
I say order at this point, not with reference to some physical point,
not with reference to time, but with reference to height and depth
of pitch. Therefore, there can be different sounds, but unless there
is a definite order among them, which is defined by definite propor­
tions, as a matter of mathematics, there will be no harmony among
the parts. On the other hand, if the sound is taken away, what audible
harmony, or if the rays of the planets are taken away, what harmony
between the configurations could be devised? Furthermore, as musi­
cal harmony is not a sound, but order among several sounds, it follows
from that that it is in the category of relations. For the order of which
we are speaking here is a relation, and the things which are ordered
are related to each other. Therefore, sounds are a harmony in virtue
of something which is an accident, inasmuch as it is found in the things
subject to it, and does not exist separately, and its absence does not
involve the dissolution of the things subject to it. Second, just as quan­
tity is universally inseparable from the bodies to which it belongs, but
can quite well be increased and diminished along with the bodies them­
selves, and yet is an accident; in the same way also the actual order
among sounds, to which we have made harmony subject as to its cate­
gory, cannot be taken away from sounds which are more than one in
number and differentiated from each other by the quantity of their
height and depth in pitch. For either they will cease to be more than
one, or if they are more than one, there will be an order among them
in respect of excess and deficiency— a changeable order indeed, if one
of the things which are related by being subject to it changes. There­
fore, order goes hand in hand with quantities, and in the same species
as number. Third, just as number is, it is defined as being a multi­
plicity assembled from units, in which Aristotle'* recognizes some­
thing analogous to matter, that is to say its units, and something formal,
the conception in the mind, which recognizes one multiplicity of those
individual units, in whatever respect it may be separated from the rest.
Thus the same philosopher says elsewhere that if the soul which counts
is taken away, all number is taken away, but not the individual units.
Hence number is found in many things themselves materially, but is
nothing apart from them, unless a mind is present to count. For only
then is number apart from things themselves, and abstracted from
things, something different from them, that is to say it is the concep- tion in the mind of the plurality of indivisible things. In the same
way also the actual order of sounds and of other sensible things with
which we are here dealing is nothing other than several sounds, unless
mind is present, comparing with each other sounds which are differ­
ent in pitch; and in general every relation is nothing without mind
apart from the things which it relates, because they do not have the
relation which they are said to have unless the presence of some mind
is assumed, to relate one to another.
Therefore, what is true in general of order and of relation is to
be presumed by far the most strongly of harmony, which is based on
proportion, and on the counting of parts which are equal in quantity.
That is to say, for some sensible harmony to exist, and for its essence
to be possible, there must be in addition to two sensible terms a soul
as well which compares them. For if that is taken away, there will in­
deed be two terms which are sensible things, but they will not be a
single harmony, which is a thing of reason.
Now we must also look at the third feature, that is to say at the
reception of external things into the mind, and the necessity and manner
of it.
O f course a harmony is a single thing, the sensible terms outside
the soul are not a single thing, and can never be made one except within
the soul. However, they cannot be within the soul unless they are re­
ceived inside it, which it does not need many words to prove from
experience. The craftsman of music in parts can indeed meditate on
the harmony of two or more voices within his mind, even though he
does not receive them into it. But that harmony is not in virtue of
that fact sensible, whereas we are speaking of the essence of what is
sensible.
Yet what is the nature of that reception? Surely the sounds, to use
a rather well-known example to stand for all, persist outside the ears,
in the air, and so before the sounds do the motions of the bodies,
according to the quantity of which the sounds follow? Do they not
remain in their bodies? By what means then do they enter? I reply,
partly actively, partly passively: actively, when they give out emana­
tions—when struck, the sounds of their own motion; when they are
shining, the rays of their own light and color; and, as we say, when
we speak of objects moving our senses. Now moving is acting. On the
other hand they enter passively, not themselves as such, but by their
emanations, which must always experience something passively, ac­
cording to our manner of speaking, when they are felt, remembered,
or compared. And in every way this very making of two terms into
one in the mind, from which the sensible essence of harmony results,
is in fact a relating and comparing in the case of things taken in con­
junction which is of the same kind as seeing and hearing in the case
of single things, and to that extent less. Certainly all these are expe­
rienced passively, but are referred to equivocally, with great ambiguity
of meaning. 

But let us establish the degrees of passive experiences. First, to
take an example, water is passive, if it is very cold and grows warm
when fires are applied to it. A second meaning is that moisture is pas­
sive, when it is actually active, that is to say in moistening what is dry,
because part of it is seized by the pores of what is desiccated, and
is mixed with it, which is passive. Similarly water is also passive when
it is sipped; for the thirsty person swallows it down, and absorbs part
of it. But in a third meaning also water is passive in the swallowing,
at least when it is in contact with the tongue, not only because it grows
warm from the warmth of the tongue, though itself it also cools the
tongue with its coldness, nor only because a bit of the water sticks
on the tongue, but simply because it is touched by the tongue, which
is like being very lightly hit, or struck, or pushed, which causes a local
motion of the parts within the whole. Now being moved is passive.
Let the fourth meaning be that in which water is said to be passive
when it emits a vapor and strikes the nostrils, and is perceived by smell­
ing. However, being perceived is passive; and in this case indeed it
is not passive itself, but its corporeal effluvium is, and by that passive
experience a bit of it is consumed. A fifth degree in which water is
understood to be passive is when its noise is heard; for first the water
itself is in motion, and second the immaterial emanation of the water,
as it moves, is diffused into everything roundabout, and is received
into the passages of the ears. This receiving is a passive experience,
not of the water itself, but of its emanation, or of its material effusion;
and in this reception something is lost in time and in a multiplicity
of receptions. For the sound is rather dulled if it reaches the ears,
or the clothes, of a great multitude, or if it is given out among falling
snow.
Sixth, also when water is seen, it is passive. For when it gives out
from its surface, or virtually so (that is from its c o lo rs ,in s o fa r as
it is colored), rays to the eye, these rays are touched, reflected, refracted,
brought to a point, and caught by the netlike coating when they are brought there. All these are passive experiences not of the water itself
but of its immaterial emanation, or rays. And those rays in this case
lose nothing at their reception, either locally or in time; for when the
thing which they touch is removed, they carry on beyond it, entirely
unimpaired, which sound does not do.
Seventh, after these emanations, and to that extent the actual body
of the water, have previously been active in a way on the bodily in­
struments of the senses, that is to say they have affected them with
their own likeness, and have assimilated them to themselves, so that
the little membranes of the tongue and skin have perceived its cold­
ness and taste, and the spirits of the nostrils its smell, the spirits of
hearing ring with its sound, and those of vision shine with its light.
Thus an imprint and sensory emanation of it has been formed, which
the eyes certainly exhibit even when it has been taken away, often against
the man’s will. In this case the sensible emanations are received within
by entrances or openings of the senses by means of a depictive or imag­
inative power, are recognized by the common s e n s e ,a r e stored by
the memory, are produced by recollection, and are discriminated
by a superior faculty. Water is understood to experience all these things
passively, not in itself, but in its sensible and intellectual emanations.
In that case, then, even the supreme faculty of the soul, which presides
over number and comparisons, constructs and forms for itself from
a number of intellectual emanations of things, a single emanation of
relation, order, and comparison, and compares things which exist out­
side it with each other. This comparison, as we said above, when it
is made about the things themselves, without any action of theirs, is
understood to be a kind of passive experience on their part, in almost
the same sense as when the reputation of someone who is not there
and knows nothing about it is discussed in a law case, or when he is
condemned to death, or proscribed. Indeed the resemblance is close
in every way. For just as someone in that position, although he himself
feels no harm at that time, and therefore experiences nothing, yet a
little later is aware in reality of the force of what he has experienced
passively, in the same way also voices, and anything else whatever that
shares in this similarity, to the extent to which they have satisfied our
intelligence in this comparison, are either continued, or rejected,
avoided, prevented obstructed, suppressed, and ended. However, I do
not say that in this case sounds have this passive experience in respect
of the consequent result, but in the actual fact of the mind’s compar­
ing them with each other. This long explanation of the degree of equivo­
cal meaning in which I speak of this mental comparison as a passive
experience is sufficient. But my prolixity in listing these meanings has 


not been in vain; for by this effort we shall from now on be wonder­
fully assisted in recognizing the nature of the harmonic faculty and
in completing this part of metaphysics, which Aristotle did not even
glance at in passing.
From this, what I was previously arguing is also clear, that is to
say that the actual formal sensible part of harmony, as harmony, is
an accident of sensible things, just as, of course, it is an accident of
the Same things to be seen and heard and so forth. Second it is evident
that even sensible harmonies are things which are in some sense ab-
stract from actual things, certainly insofar as it is not external things
in themselves, but the emanations of things, which enter through the
senses, which are brought before the tribunal of the soul, and are made
the terms of sensible harmonic proportion. Yet on the other hand
these harmonies are still concrete in a double sense: first, because these
emanations of sensible things are not emanations of their mere quan­
tity, but also of their sensible quality, say of sound or light and so on;
and second because these sensible emanations, as sensible, cannot give
light within the mind unless the actual things of which they are ema­
nations are also present and remain present outside. For if they are
taken away, their emanations within also cease, those of light indeed,
with respect to their radiation, on the instant, but those of sound within
a very brief moment of time. There remains indeed in the instruments
of sensation a certain impression, such as that of light in the eye;''*
but it is not an emanation of the external thing, but rather another
emanation of an emanation, impressed on the body, and now become
a momentary quality of the body, just as in optics colors, by the pure
and very little colored light of the Sun, take on the power of radiating
in color in every direction. And this is what we were also arguing at
the outset, that the sensible terms and the soul must be present, and
deliver their mutual efforts, actively and passively, the former by mov­
ing the senses, the latter by comparing. Hence the essence of sensible
harmony is established.
Here someone may object that the soul in comparing does not
make the appropriate proportion but discovers it. (This was the fourth
formal basic element of harmony above.) Therefore, it seems that
i

^

the soul cau be absent without loss of the essence of harmony,
I reply by inverting the question. To find the appropriate propor 

tion in sensible things is to uncover and recognize and bring to light
a similarity of that proportion in sensible things to some particular
archetype of the truest harmony which is within the soul. Therefore,
just as the Athenians found some virtue in Zeno, and did not find the
privileges of the Prytaneum*'’ in him but conferred them on him,
which Zeno could not achieve without the Athenians, so the soul finds
order and proportion in the sounds and rays (although it does not
find even that outside, but in fact the terms, as stated), but makes this
proportion harmonic itself by comparison with its archetype. It could
not be called harmonic, and would be allotted no power in moving
spirits, if this archetype did not exist. Enough, then, on sensible
harmonies.
For now we must move on to the pure and secret harmonies, that what insensible
is to the other limb of our division; in other words to those which *iarmony is.
we have just now established as archetypes or paradigms of sensible
harmonies. For if the archetypes had their existence outside the soul,
I confess for my part that we should be deprived of a great argument
for asserting the necessity of the soul, in order to establish the essence
of harmony. But to establish them outside the soul is self-contradictory,
as we shall hear.
For the basic elements of true and archetypal harmony, which exists its terms,
without any tinge of sensible emanation, are nevertheless divided and
several in number. For since it is also a proportion, it therefore itself
requires its pair of terms. However, these terms, as we have assumed
in the previous Books, are the complete circle and an aliquot part
or aliquot parts of it, which are constructible by division of the arc.
This is the specific distinguishing feature of harmonic proportion,
by which not only is harmonic proportion differentiated from other
proportions which are classified in the same category, but also the
pure and archetypal harmony from the sensible ones, except insofar
as in the familiar common usage only the congruity of sounds is called
harmony. For pure harmony is most clearly differentiated from sen­
sible or concrete harmony by the very fact that in pure harmony the
terms come from mathematical categories, the circle and the arc,
formed in a certain way, as the circle takes its form and shape from
itself, and the arc takes its terms from its chord, its shape from the
circle; whereas in the case of the sensible harmonies there is no need
of this special formation. For they can be either straight lines or sen­
sible quantities shaped in some other way, provided they are faithful
copies of this archetypal harmony of theirs, each in its own quantity,
or indeed as much of a faithful imitation as is possible in sensible
things. For in their case what is close to the truth, more or less, is accepted as the truth itself. These, then, are the terms of the arche­
typal harmony.
Second, as well as the terms, again as has been stated previously
in the case of sensible harmonies, a mind is also required, which com­
pares the terms, and assesses whether they, being of course arcs of
a circle, are such as some side of a constructible figure divides off from
the whole circle. Thus in a sense there are three basic elements of
the archetypal harmony, two with respect to the terms, the material,
to express it by an analogy, the circle and its part, and the formal,
the division of the part by a constructible figure; and one with respect
to the actual relation of the terms, that is to say the mind which in
a sense brings it into being.
And since every proportion, and so also this proportion of a part
of a circle to the whole, is predicated of a relation, in this case this
definite and prescribed form of a proportion is to be found to be a
quality of the fourth kind.*® For harmony is a relation, in a sense, of
quality or shape, being formed from the regular figures.
But if it belonged to the essence of sensible harmony previously
that sensible things should flow into the soul by means of an ema­
nation, how much more is it also necessary in this case than what we
have stated as the terms of the secret harmony, the circle and its arc,
should be within the mind itself, whether that is said to have come
about by the reception into it of emanations, or whether they have
been with the mind always, and present before anything was received
into it. From now on this must be examined with the full power of
my talents.
However, since we have now arrived at this point, we cannot in
fact without considerable injustice both to the reader who is eager
for philosophy and to the ancients, who handled this part of philos­
ophy before us, conceal their opinions on the same topics, insofar
indeed as they are known to us. I judge that only one thing must be
said by way of preface: that a distinction must be drawn between the
actual mathematical species, the circle and its arc, and a comparison
between them. And the reason for that is that if the actual species,
as terms, must be located in the mind without being received, it will
be even more important to locate harmony, which occurs between those
parts, in the mind, so that it does not have its essence outside it,
inasmuch as its essence consists of some action of the mind on those
species. Also the circle along with its arcs is in the soul in such a way
that beyond controversy they are in sensible things as well; but har­
mony, which is between the circle and its part, as far as its formal aspect
is concerned, is in no way outside the soul, as was made clear above
by the example of number. In this case the arguments of the ancients are especially about the actual species, which is a simpler matter;
whereas harmony is more a compound matter.
Also there is this difference between Aristotle, Plato, and Proclus
on the one hand, and Ptolemy on the other. For the former deal with
essence of the emanations, Ptolemy with the essence of harmony.*’
But we shall defer the text of Ptolemy until the Appendix of the whole
work, in case, as we feared at the start of this chapter, he incites the
crowds against us; whereas we shall now listen to those who say what
is most apposite to the present investigation.
Now Plato’s view on mathematical things was that the human mind
is in itself thoroughly informed on species or figures, and axioms and
conclusions about things. However, when it seems to learn, it is merely
being reminded by sensible diagrams of those things which it knows
on its own account. He conveys that with singular ingenuity in the
Dialogues by introducing a slave who when questioned by his master
makes all the replies as desired.*®
Aristotle on the contrary in his Metaphysics^^ calls this a fabrica­
tion, “a fictitious argument, twisted to fit the hypothesis,” as neither
do these Mathematicals ever exist independently of sensible things,
nor is their character, even in the mind, on any different basis from
that on which other universals are in the mind, as the species of the
actual essence of individual sensible things is formed in the mind by
definition. Thus they are indeed prior to sensible things, and abstracted
from sensible things, yet not in reality, but in mental conception. Hence
it should be noticed that Aristotle, almost every time he happens to name any one of the mathematical categories by way of example, al­
ways names either a point, or a line, or a surface, or a body, or a num­
ber, which are the chief categories of which quantity is predicated;
but mention is very rarely made, throughout these treatises indeed,
of quantities insofar as they are shapes, and in the fourth species of
quality (where their material aspect, quantity, is one thing, but their
formal aspect, shape, another); and insofar as they are relations, ab­
solutely no mention at all. Indeed he even proposes harmonic knowl­
edge for investigation with reference to nothing except voices, and
to them solely insofar as they are lines,^" exactly as in optics. How­
ever, of the interval between the lines, which are a proportion (a re­
lation, of course, and that indeed of quality and shape) Aristotle never
even dreams.
Thus there is no doubt that he would have made greater progress
in this investigation if he had been imbued with more profound math­
ematics (concerning the intelligible difference between possible and
impossible figures, 2 ' with which we have dealt in Book I). Therefore,
as far as he is discussing the chief categories of quantity, he is an easy
victor, with no opposition. However, where he draws a universal* con­
clusion, and convicts Plato of the stupidity which is his own fantasy,
and finally where to the Platonic picture of the “selftaught” slave he
opposes a contrary picture of his own, asserting that the mind in itself
is empty, not only of other knowledge and of mathematical categories
but also of species,22 and is just a blank sheet, so that nothing is writ­
ten on it, not even any mathematicals, but everything can be written
on it; from this aspect, I say, he is not to be tolerated in the Christian
religion, and several centuries later he found many “correctors,” as
Proclus says, including Proclus himself as opponent, though here he
does not cite Aristotle himself by name, but he names Plato, whom
he defends, and openly admits him as his leader.
Therefore, the philosophy of this Proclus on the species of mathe­
matical things, which I confess to be the terms of harmonic propor­
tion which is pure and hidden from sensible things, is worth tran­
scribing here word for word from his Book I on Euclid.^'^
He writes as follows: It remains for us to see what character or essence
should be assigned to mathematical categories and species. Should it be conceded
that they receive their character from sensible things, whether by abstraction,
as it is customarily called, or by bringing together things which have been dis­
persed in various parts into one common concept (or definition), or even prior
to that must a character be granted to them, as Plato claims, and the devel­
opment of the totality of things shows'? 

First, then, if we assert that mathematical species are established from sen­
sible things, when the soul forms within itselffrom material triangles or circles
the circular and triangular species, by a kind of secondary generation, I ask
where the concepts (or definitions) get such great certainty, and such great ac­
curacy. For it will be either from sensible things or from the soul itself. But
is it not impossible for it to be from sensible things, as there is much greater
subtlety and exactness in these concepts? Therefore, it is from the soul, which
procures perfection for imperfect things, and that accurate subtlety for things
which are greatly inaccurate.
For tell me where among sensible things is to be found the nature which
is indivisible (a point) or which has no breadth (such as a line) or depth
(such as a surface) or where the equality of lines from the center, or where
the perpetually constant proportions of sides (the material of my Book I)
or the rightness of angles is to be found. For my part, as all divisible things
are mingled and confused with each other, I see nothing pure, nothing unmixed
with its contrary: all things, both those which are in scattered positions and
those which are united are divisible. How therefore shall we procure their endur­
ing essencefor immovable things from things which are movable, and are different
in different places? For they allow that whatever takes its character from mobile
essences takes an alterable character. And how shall we bring about their ac­
curacy for accurate and certain species from things which are not accurate? For
everything which is the cause of a perpetually changeable notion is much more
so itself. Then it will have to be supposed that the soul itself is the generator
of mathematical species and concepts. But if, containing them in itself as first
patterns or paradigms, it makes them take their essential character, in such
a way that their generation (the Christian understands, the creation of
sensible things) is nothing but the propagation of species which were previ­
ously in it (that the mathematical reasons for the creation of bodies
were coeternal with God, and that God is pre-eminently soul and mind,
whereas human souls are images of God the Creator, even in essen­
tials in their own way, is known to Christians) then we shall agree with
Plato, in saying this, and the true essence of mathematics will have been dis­
covered by us. But if on the other hand the soul, since it did not have the mathe­
matical concepts and had not previously received them from anywhere (if it
was because they had not been created along with it) nevertheless weaves
this wonderful immaterial equipage, it promotes this very splendid speculation:
how, then, does it in that case distinguish whether the things which it has gen­
erated are real and stable (I read poviga, “stable,” not yovipa, “generative”)
or gone with the wind, and specters rather than true? What norms will it use
to measure their truth? Indeed how, since it did not measure their essence, does
it generate such a great variety of concepts? For on this basis we shall make
their character accidental, and not aiming at any goal or end. Then mathe­
matical species are the offspring of the soul itself, and it does not take the con­
cepts which it establishes from sensible things. On the contrary, the latter are
propagated from the former; these are its progeny, and clearly this is how per­
manent and perennial species are born.
Second, if we assemble the concepts of mathematics (or definitions) from below

and from sensible things, surely the proofs which sensible things establish will
he better than the proofs of universal and simple species'^ For we say that, for
investigating the subject of an enquiry, wherever there are basic assumptions
and propositions, they are related to the proofs or conclusions. If, therefore, in­
dividual things are the causes for universals, sensible things for objects of
thought, how can it come about that the end of the proof is referred to the more
universal, not to the particular, and that we show that the essence of intelligible
things is more closely related to the proofs than that of sensible things^ For what
they say is this: if someone proves that an isosceles triangle has angles equal
to two right angles, and the same of an equilateral one, and the same of a scalene
one, that is not legitimately knowing; but someone will have knowledge properly
so called if he has proved that of every triangle without qualification. Again:
universals are better for proof than particulars. Further: proofs refer more to
universals, and indeed the things of which proofs are constructed are prior, and
by nature precede singulars, and are the causes of that which is proved. There­
fore, the demonstrative branches of knowledge are very farfrom assembling their
propositions like beggars around sensible things which are posterior in origin
and more obscure. I shall say it once more, and for a third time: those who say
this make the soul baser than the actual species. For if matter takes from nature
things which are essential, and closer to reality, and more obvious, whereas the
soul receives them from it by a secondary act, and constructs the patterns and
images in itself with a secondary origin, looking to baser essences and abstract-
ing from matter things which are inseparable according to its own nature, are
they not making soul more needy and more obscure than matter'? For matter
is also the place for material concepts, just as soul is for species (immaterial).
For the former would be the place for that which is prior, the latter for that
which is secondary, and the former for that which holds the lead in existence,
the latter for that which takes its character from it, and finally the former for
that which is made in accordance with its essence, the latter for that which
is named according to its implications. How therefore can soul, which shares
in mind and the intelligible first essence, and which thence has complete knowl­
edge, how, I say, can it also be the receptacle for the most obscure species of the
whole of life, that is to say of the lowest degree among things, and of all that
is most imperfect in its existence? Indeed I consider it entirely superfluous to
mount more attacks on this opinion, which has long since deservedly been flogged
by many.
But if mathematical species do not have their existence by abstraction from
material things, nor by assembling common features which are found in indi­
vidual things, and are not at all secondary in origin, or drawn from sensible
things, it will indeed necessarily be the case that the soul adopts them either
from itself or from Mind, or indeed from both itself and Mind at the same time.
Yet if it is from itself alone, how will they he images of intelligible species, how
will they be intermediate between divisible and indivisible nature, though they
obtain no integration of the first-named for their existence? Lastly, how are the
first patterns, the paradigms or ideas, which are in the mind, the originators
of universals?
But if on the other hand it is from Mind alone that they are adopted by the soul, how can the soul remain itself, functioning of itself and moving itself,
if the concepts which are in it have flowed into itselffrom elsewhere, according
to the standard of the natures of those things which are activated by something
else? And in what way will the soul differ from Matter, which is everything
only in potential, but generates nothing among material species?
The remaining possibility, therefore, is that the .soul adopts them both from
itself andfrom Mind, and so that it is itself an absolute integration of the species
which take their nature and obtain entry to existence from the intelligible first
patterns or paradigms which are generated by themselves. Then the soul is in
no way a blank sheet, empty of all thoughts; but it is always a written sheet,
and it both writes of itself on itself, and is filled with writings by Mind. For
the soul is a Mind, or a kind of Intellect, which reflects on itself in accordance
with an Intellect which is prior to itself, having become an image of it and
a representation or external copy of it. If, therefore, it is everything intellectually,
soul will also be all things spiritually; and if Intellect is everything as a pattern,
soul will be in the manner of an image; and if Intellect is everything in com­
bination and unity, soul will be in a divided way. Since Plato also had under­
stood that, he constituted soul from all things, and divided it according to num­
bers, and linked it to proportions and harmonic ratios; and he related to it the
first basic principles, which are responsible for the figures (I mean the straight
and the curved), and he sets in motion the circles, which are in it intellectually.
Then everything mathematical is first of all in the soul, and before numbers
there are the numbers which set themselves in motion, and before the seen figures
there are the lifegiving figures; and before the consonant and the melodic there
are the actual ratios of the consonances, or harmonic ratios; and before the bodies
which are moved in a circle the actual invisible orbits were established. And
Soul is the integration of all things; and it is a sort of embellishment of a differ­
ent kind (from the sensible) which both applies itself of itself (to things) and
is applied from a basic principle which is related and akin; and it both fills
itself with life of itself, and is filled by the Creator by a means which is incor­
poreal and unlocalized. (He is not far from every one of us; in Him we
live, move and have our being.)^'^ And when He puts forward and expounds
its ratios. He then also reveals all bodies of knowledge and all virtues. Therefore,
Soul has its essence in these species; and it must not be supposed that Number,
which is in it, is a multiplicity of units, nor that the form and idea of those
things which may be scattered in space must be understood as corporeal; but
all things must be taken as lifegiving and intellectual, and as the first originals
of visible numbers and figures and ratios and motions. And here we must follow
Timaeus, who integrates and completes the whole source and structure from
the mathematical types, and locates in it the causes of all things. For those seven
terms of all numbers pre-existed in it, as far as cause is concerned.'^^ Again the
basic principles of the figures have been located in it in the architectonic or structural sense; and the first and chiefmost of all the motions, which surrounds
and rouses all other motions, existed along with it. For of all that moves, the
basic principle is the circle, and circular motion. Therefore, the concepts of mathe­
matical things, which integrate souls, are essential and self-moving; and Soul
putting them forward and propagating them and unfolding them, causes the
whole variety of mathematical knowledge to persist. For it will never happen
that it ceases to engender and bring to light one thing after another continu­
ously, while it uncovers its concepts which are indivisible in their simplicity.
For it has previously received everything, by way of chief and primeval species;
and in accordance with its limitless ability, from the basic principles which
it has previously adopted, it constructs the development of contemplations of
every kind. So much for Proclus.
I wanted to transcribe the whole passage, not only because he set
the genuine terms of the harmonies, the circles and the arcs cut off
by the figures, among other mathematical things, in the soul and in
the mind essentially, in such a way that these mathematical things be­
come for the soul and correspondingly the soul for them (insofar as
they are separated from individual things) like a sort of essence, but
also because he removes from me, who am putting forward similar
views, the blame for rejecting Aristotle in both directions, and gives
an outstanding recommendation to this philosophy.
On numbers, indeed, I should not contest the view that Aristotle
rightly refuted the Pythagoreans; for the numbers are at second re­
move, in a sense, or even at third, and fourth, and beyond any limit
I can state, and they have in them nothing which they have not got
either from quantities, or from other true and real entities, or even
from various products of Mind. Thus I do not attribute anything either
to the Platonic numbers, which are attributed to the change in Re­
publics, which Bodin adopts in his Historical Method, nor to those called
Climacteric, that is on their own account, except insofar as they num-
revolutions and configurations of the stars, as I indicated not
long ago openly enough in the prolegomena to the Ephemerides.'^^^
But as far as continuous quantities are concerned, I entirely agree
with Proclus, though his rhetoric sweeps on like a torrent, overflowing
its banks and concealing the hidden shoals and whirlpools of doubt,
while his mind, full of the majesty of such great matters, struggles in
the constraints of language, and his conclusion, never satisfying itself with the flood of words, oversteps the simplicity of his propositions.
I therefore believe that if I now append my reasons why I establish
the intellectual circle and its parts as the terms for the insensible har­
monies (reasons which I had conceived before I had read Proclus),
I shall not only be saying what agrees with Proclus but also making
a kind of summary of the passage quoted, as far indeed as it serves
my purpose.
I shall not state among my reasons that as the objects which are The terms of the

harmonies are
abstracted finally from things and from the sensible emanations of abstract
things, a sense which the term “abstracting” properly engenders; for quantities,
as has been stated above, this process of abstraction relates to the sen­
sible harmonies of sounds and rays, and comes into the reckoning
only when, just as the good or evil deeds of citizens are adjudged by
laws which were passed long ago, sounds and rays are adjudged by the
archetypal harmony which is already present within.
But this is the reason why the quantity which provides the terms
for the harmonic proportions is said to be intellectual, because that
quantity must be capable of by far the most subtle construction. Yet
that construction is never drawn from sensible things in a diagram,
though it is assisted by them; and it does not arise from the assembling
of many individual sensible things into one axiom, but it is obtained
a priori. The valid objection which Proclus made to Aristotle, generally
understood in this way, I can thoroughly confirm in particular with
absolutely clear arguments taken from Book I. For of the figures which
cut off a harmonic arc of a circle the specific difference, by which,
as a part of their definition, their essence is exhibited, is the fact that
they must be knowable. Yet what after all is knowability without Mind,
which is capable of knowledge? And do not say that it can be the case
that knowledge is not knowledge of something; for knowledge consists
in comparison, as when the side of a figure is equal to the semidi­
ameter. What equality may then be without a mind, especially in the
case of things which are independent of place, is unintelligible; and
we return to the argument already adduced above for harmonies which
are also sensible.
Also they must be not only knowable but also known, so that the
archetypal harmony may in fact shine forth within the mind. For the
possibility of knowing is not sufficient for us as a criterion of sensible
harmonies. Therefore, if a part of the essence of something is within
the mind, and thus in its operation or activity, that thing must be es­
tablished within, that is to say the terms of the harmonies, the circle
and its part.
You may ask how knowledge of a thing can be possessed, when The soul has

prived of sensation of external things? To this Proclus replies above instinct,
in words which are commonplace in his philosophy: we today, if I am
not mistaken, quite correctly use the term “instinct.” Indeed to the 

human mind and to other minds quantity is known by instinct, even
if for this purpose it is deprived of all sensation. Of itself it under­
stands a straight line, of itself an equal distance from a given point,
of itself it forms for itself from these an image of a circle. If so, it can
much more readily find the construction by means of that, and so
perform the function of the eye in seeing the diagram (if there is never­
theless a need for one). Certainly the mind itself, if it never had the
use of an eye at all, would demand an eye for itself for the compre­
hension of things which are placed outside it, and would lay down
laws for its structure which were drawn from itself (if in fact it were
pure and sound and without hindrance, that is, if it were only what it

from sensible things but of never having been associated with them,
therefore, we have rightly established abstract quantity as the terms
for archetypal proportions, that is those which are constructible from
the divisions of the circle.
There is another reason why I choose abstract quantities, that the
circle, which is a figure, that is a species of the fourth kind, although
it is a quantity, yet in this connection is considered purely as a figure,
without distinction between large and small, to such an extent that
it is in a sense abstracted from quantity itself, as if from what is subject
to it, and its nature can be recognized even in the narrow space of
a point. This, I think, was what Proclus meant when he said that mathe­
matical things existed in the soul in an uncorporeal and unlocalized
mode.
The symbolism
Finally there is a chief and supreme argument, that quantities pos­
of divine and
sess a certain wonderful and obviously divine organization, and there

them. Of the semblance of the Holy Trinity in the spherical I have
written in many places^^ in my Optics, in my Commentaries on Mars, and in the theory of the sphere; and I want to return to the subject here.
We come, therefore, to the straight line, which by its extension from
a point at the center to a single point at the surface sketches out the
first rudiments of creation, and imitates the eternal begetting of the
Son (represented and depicted by the departure from the center to­
wards the infinite points of the whole surface, by infinite lines, subject
to the most perfect equality in all respects); and this straight line is
of course an element of a corporeal form. If this is spread out side­
ways, it now suggests a corporeal form, creating a plane; but a spheri­
cal shape cut by a plane gives the shape of a circle at its section, a
true image of the created mind, which is in charge of ruling the body.
It is in the same proportion to the spherical as the human mind is
to the divine, that is to say as a line to a surface, though each is cir­
cular; but to the plane, in which it is also placed, it is as the curved
to the straight, which are incompatible and incommensurable. Also
the circle exists splendidly both in the plane which cuts, circumscrib­
ing the spherical shape, and in the spherical shape which is cut, by
the mutual concurrence of the two, just as the mind both exists in
the body, giving form to it and to its connections with the corporeal
form, like a kind of irradiation shed from the divine face onto the
body and drawing thence its more noble nature. Just as this is a con­
firmation from the harmonic proportions of the circle as the subject
and the source of their terms, equally it is the strongest possible argu­
ment for abstraction, as the suggestion of the divinity of the mind
exists neither in a circle of definite quantity, nor in an imperfect one,
for they are material and sensible. The main point is that the circle
should be abstracted from corporeal and sensible things to the same
extent as concepts of the curved, the symbol of the mind, are sepa­
rated and, so to speak, abstracted from the straight, the shadow of
bodies. Therefore, we have sufficient support for seeking the terms
for harmonic proportions, which are objects of the mind alone, chiefly
in abstract quantities.
Therefore, to conclude this section we shall gather the chief points
in a package. For the sensible harmonies have this in common with
the archetypal ones, that they demand terms and comparison of them,
an activity of the soul itself: the essence of both consists in this com­
parison. But the terms of the sensible harmonies are sensible, and
must be present outside the soul: the terms of the archetypal har­
monies are present within the soul beforehand, Therefore, the sen­
sible harmonies need in addition to be received by means of an emanation which they have emitted; and it is by the senses, the servants
of the soul, that they are received. Another comparison is also needed,
of the individual; sensible terms with the individual archetypal ones,
I mean with the circle and a knowable part of it; but the archetypal
harmony has neither need, as its terms are present in the soul before­
hand, and inborn in it, and in fact are the soul itself, and they are
not an image of their true pattern, but are in a sense their own pat­
tern. Thus only a simple comparison, which the soul sets up, of its
own parts with each other, so to speak, completes the whole essence
of the archetypal harmony. Finally the soul itself, engaged in this ac­
tivity, is the harmony with which we are concerned, just as, without
reference to this activity, the circle and its part are, that is to say they
are the terms of the harmony; and in the end harmony is wholly
spiritualized, and so deified.
