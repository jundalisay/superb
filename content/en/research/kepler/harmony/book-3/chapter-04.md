As sensation bears witness that of strings which are under equal ten­
sion the longer ones give lower sounds, and the shorter ones give higher
sounds, hence these linked words, hig-h and low, are the appropriate
differences in harmony. For individually indeed they belong separately
to other individual branches of knowledge, in which they are joined
with other opposites: acute [the same word in Latin as high] with obtuse,
in geometry; heavy [the same word in Latin as low] with light in physics.
And in other contexts, sharp [the same word in Latin as high] expresses
the meaning thin and penetrating; heavy [the same word in Latin as
low] in matters of sensation is adopted for smells which, like heavy
weights, on account of their magnitude are less bearable. But high and
low linked together, and opposed to each other, are used only about
musical notes. However, they keep some of their original meaning.
For as in geometry acute is less than obtuse, so also in harmony a high
note expresses the meaning small, and so penetrating and raised, in
the Teutonic idiom, and fluttering as if raised aloft, on account of a
certain lightness. And as in physics heavy things have a great weight,
and light things a small, so also in this case a low note expresses the
meaning “large”; and as things which are heavy in weight seek the depth
and what is low, while light things soar up to the heights, so also in
harmony, a low note on account of its magnitude is considered weighty,
and so deeper or profound (bass), and a high note, as stated, is con­
sidered raised. For the fact that on the lute the first string, that is the
highest, gave out a low sound was due only to its position on the in­
strument, as still today, and not on account of any similarity of the
note to things which are light and fluttering aloft. However its position
on the instrument has a mechanical reason, from the fact that the
end string, that is the last and lowest, had to be struck most frequently
because it gives the highest sound, as swift motion is convenient for
small things, and indeed we strike downwards more readily than up­
wards on account of the shape of the thumb. A further reason is ex­
perience of the human throat. For not only in general are men domi­
nant over women, and grown men over boys, and also give out a lower
note, as if drawn from a greater depth, but also individual men, as we
learn from the sense of touch, extract a lower note from a greater depth,
and a higher from above; and those who sing lowest extend the body
so that the note may emerge as deeply as possible. Indeed those who
sing high also stretch their necks, yet not to make their necks long,
but to tighten more effectively the upper bands of their throats. 


Therefore it was for these reasons that there was born in harmony
the concept of raised and deep, for which we frequently use high and
low. Therefore since high and deep are at other times words referring
to place, the habit of speech, following these its basic principles, also
adapts to notes what properly belongs to places, that is to say intervals.
What a diastema
in Greek 6iaoTfigaTa, “separations.” For it is places which are said to
or interval is.
^ distance, 5iioTavai, “be separated.” Lastly, the discipline of har­
mony has also transferred this word to its pictorial representations
or staves (which will be treated below), as they consist of high and
low lines. On that basis the geometrical sense has been restored to
the word.
Therefore what were hitherto called the proportions of the strings
will in future generally be called the intervals of notes which strings
of unequal length give out. For notes of the same sound, correspond­
ing with strings of equal length and equal tensions, do not make an
interval, since they are of equal pitch.
Nevertheless in Book V this sense of the word “interval” will have
to be avoided, because there the use of the word in its astronomical
sense will have to be frequently repeated, referring to the straight line
between the body of a planet and the Sun, and also to the space be­
tween different spheres.
What a superior
Furthermore in the preceding Chapter the proportions were con-
^nt'r^a” is^ sidered under two headings, that is to say either individually or in
their own right, or in relation to each other with respect to their order,
which extended from the smaller term, or string, of some compound
proportion, to the greater or longer, and the other way round. Now
the intervals also are considered either individually or in their own
right, or in relation to each other, with respect to their harmonic posi­
tion. Thus in the continuous ordering of a number of intervals (as
when every pair of adjacent intervals always has the same term in com­
mon, which is the greater term of one, and the lesser of the other
which is in the direction of the lower notes) the interval which is be­
tween the lower notes is always called the inferior one, and the one
which is between the higher notes the superior.
What equal
And in geometry indeed proportions are recognized as equal even
intervals are.
terms of One are not equal to the terms of the other, and the
difference between the terms of one is not equal to the difference be­
tween the terms of the other. Thus if there are three strings in the
proportions of the numbers 4:6:9, the proportion 4:6 is considered
the same as 6:9 notwithstanding that both the actual terms, and also
the differences 2 and 3 are unequal.
In harmony similarly all intervals between notes coming from the
strings which are in the same proportion are both consid-
ered equal and are also written with the same numerical mark.
Furthermore they are depicted on the stave with equal inter-
^ p
vals of lines, so that we completely forget the inequality which
—.
there is between the differences of the various strings. 


It therefore follows that we call the intervals which have a smaller
proportion, smaller [in Latin “minor”] and those which have a greater
proportion greater [in Latin “major”], without regard to the greatness
or smallness of the corresponding terms in either case.
Therefore with these preliminary statements serving as definitions,
we must now proceed to examine the differences between the intervals.
So far indeed all the proportions which we have shown to be consonant,
with the sole exception of equality, must be taken to represent the
^
same number of intervals which are m like manner consonant; whereas
the proportions which we have said to be dissonant represent a like
number of dissonant intervals. However, there is a great difference
between the dissonant intervals, so that not only are the consonant
intervals taught to us by Nature and approved by hearing at her prompt­
ing, but other smaller intervals are also established by the same sense
which although
they J are dissonant are yet
suitable for conveying
melody.

Harmony, following Nature, attaches to them the name of melodic,
and distinguishes them from the unmelodic, which have no place in
the flow of any ordered melody. In Greek they are called
“in
melody” and 8KM,eX,f|, “outside melody.”
When the ancients saw this ingenuity of Nature in distinguishing
between the melodic and unmelodic, they therefore thought they should
try to find what was the smallest element common to the melodic and
the consonant, by taking some number of which any consonance or
melodic interval could be made up. For it seemed necessary that some
such smallest interval should exist, as simple, and prior in origin to the
consonances themselves, which seemed to be made up of such a small­
est element, inasmuch as some intervals were larger than others.*’’
Yet the reality is far different, as can be learnt from many examples.
For if in all species the individuals, which differ in size, are made up
of one common smallest element, therefore there will be some single
smallest quantity of the human species; and from some definite number
of striplings of that kind, as if from elements, any man you like may
be composed, a lofty one from many, a dwarf from few. For in har­
mony the quality known as consonance shapes the proportion of the
strings, or the interval of the notes, just as much as the shape of a
man shapes that mass of matter which is surrounded by a man’s skin.
And why did they forget geometry, in which there are a great many
examples of every kind of incommensurable quantities, which are
defined as sharing no common measure whatever, which belongs to
quantities of the same kind, as a definite quantity of some element
of their composition


Therefore we must accept that consonant intervals (except in cases
^here One is a multiple of the other) are, like the actual proportions,
incommensurable, in such a way indeed that although their differ­
ences may be expressed in numbers, which in simple numbers is a
sign of commensurability, yet these differences, not of course being
simple numbers but fractions, are not an aliquot part or aliquot parts
of the differing terms, in relation to any number. For instance the two
proportions 1:2 and 1:4 are to each other as the number 1 to the
number 2. They are, then, commensurable, for 1:4 is twice T2. There
is room for this in the series of continuous doubling alone.**” For in
the series of triples, and the other multiples, two consonant propor­
tions do not occur. Thus 1:9 is indeed triple 1:3; but only 1:3 is among
the consonances, and T9 is among the dissonances, by Axiom 111. We
can see the same thing in non-multiples. Thus in the case of the sesqui-
alterate proportion, 2:3, a consonance, its multiple certainly occurs
and is thus commensurable; for 4:9 is to 2:3 as the number 2 is to
1, but 4:9 is not among the consonances. On the contrary two others
are consonant, as in the series of continuous doubles, like T4 and 2:3.
These two proportions are not commensurable with each other, that
is, they are not as number to number; for the excess of T 4 over 2:3,
3:8, is not measurable by either T4 or 2:3.
Therefore the consonant intervals are by nature prior to the smaller
intervals which we name melodic; and they are not composed of melodic
intervals as if of elements, or of some smaller quantity, but on the
contrary the melodic intervals arise from the consonances, as if from
causes.

At this point we must take note that the word “composition” is ambiguous. Sometimes it denotes the natural origin of a thing, some times however the quantitative division of a thing, which is not an
origin, but rather a destruction, as when we say that a circle is made
up of three thirds, first mentally dividing the circle into three, or
when we say that the human body is composed of members, not
because the members existed before the body, and the body was as­
sembled and constructed from them, as a house is from stones and
wood, but because the body in virtue of its bulk is divisible into these
members, which separately and independently are no longer a functional body.


In the former sense we must say that consonant intervals are com ­
posed neither of other consonances nor of melodic intervals. In the
latter sense the consonant intervals, which are larger, certainly do con­
sist, and are thus in a sense composed (as we ourselves have assumed
previously) of the smaller consonances, and the smallest consonances
of melodic intervals, and so on, because they are analyzed into these
elements, so to speak; but the various intervals among themselves
do not consist of some larger number of intervals of a single very
small kind, common to each other, and cannot be analyzed into any
such.
However, the consonant intervals also have related causes, yet they
do not all have the same cause, but each its own special cause, distinct
from the others’ causes, as has been explained previously. For conso­
nance is a property of the actual intervals, not according to their quan­
tity directly, nor directly according to their relationships, but accord­
ing to their relationships qualitatively (that is, in a sense, as figured).
Thus to seek to establish a smallest interval which is common to them
is inappropriate, since smallest and greatest are observed not in qual­
ities but in bare quantities and in their proportions, whereas to divide
consonances, as consonances, is to destroy a kind of consonance, and
in its place to establish either other kinds of consonance, or dissonant
melodic intervals, or even downright unmelodic intervals. An interval
therefore does not take the causes or elements of its consonance from
parts as if they were basic principles, in the same way as commensurable
quantities are built up by the multiplication of a common measure,
and along with that measure belong to one and the same type. On
the contrary, what the ancients took to be the basic principles of con­
sonances (tones, I mean, and semitones and dieses”^) originate from
the consonances as their true basic principles.
For although the consonances do consist of these melodic inter- The type of a
vals which are not consonant (if not from a single one in common, consonance as
^
such does not
at least from several combined with each other in various ways), yet arise from
that must not be attributed to the actual consonance of the interval,
number of
melodic intervals
For if the melodic intervals imparted to a larger interval, which was
composed of them, its own consonance, that would always occur in
any multiple of melodic intervals, and the more melodic intervals there
were in it, the better would be the consonance. However that is false,
for as we shall hear below, two tones combined make a consonance,
three combined make up a dissonant interval.
Nevertheless the fact that a consonance can be analyzed into dis­
sonant melodic intervals, as will follow, is clearly accidental to that
consonance considered on its own, and occurs only insofar as several

consonances are compared with each other, each originating from
its own basic principles.
Therefore melodic intervals are defined as being all the differences
between consonances which are smaller than the double interval;’”
and the natural faculty of hearing does not admit any other intervals
as melodic but those which arise from this subtraction. Thus the con­
sonant intervals take their origin from geometry and the construct-
ible figures, but the melodic intervals from the actual consonances;
and the melodic intervals stand in relation to the consonances just
as in geometry the Apotomae (inexpressible lines) stand to those ex­
pressible in square, for the former are also defined by subtraction of
an expressible line from an expressible line.* *
Furthermore there is one method of comparison or abstraction
which is general or arithmetic, and another which is special, and proper
to harmony. But it is by arithmetical means that consonances which
are less than double are selected, so that one of them is not a part
of another, in the sense of being indicated by some harmonic mean,
as in the previous chapter.

The harmonic comparison of consonant intervals re­
fers to their origin, and to the degree of height which
is assigned to each of them on account of its origin.
For every greater term in the comparison of propor­
. . . X A tions is represented by one and the same whole circle,
2 5 and the complete string which is analogous to it,
as common to all harmonic divisions. Therefore we have to find for all
the numbers representing the greater terms in the seven harmonic divi­
sions, that is to say 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 8, a lowest common multiple, 120;
and the whole string must be divided into the same number of equal
parts, so that the sound of the whole string is established as the com­
mon greater term of all the consonances made by the divisions, and
the smaller terms must be fitted in such a way that when set along side
each other they set up the melodic intervals, which are investigated in
this Chapter. However the results are the same as before, arithmetically. This, therefore, is the origin of the dissonant melodic intervals,
to which we shall give their names a little later on.^^
The next thing is for us to speak also of the origin of third inter­
vals, which although they are not exactly melodic, yet are useful in
melody, and serve the purpose of melodic intervals.^*^ Now they arise
from the subtraction or comparison of melodic intervals (in the same
way as melodic intervals from those of consonances). For between
melodic intervals or seconds are the following third intervals:^^

Which is composed of 24:25 and 80:81 and
is a very little less than 15:16.

25
To those can be added twice the interval 15:16, or in other words
225:226, which is greater than the interval 8:9 by a little less than 15-T6
is greater than the interval 128:135. Now the first three indeed arise
from the mutual division of various melodic intervals; but this last
from the addition of two melodic intervals which are equal, but in
a less common way.
Hence springs to notice a very splendid

That is to say, the square of every number below ten, together with
the rectangle having the two numbers which are its closest neighbors 


as sides, makes up either a consonance or a melodic interval or a third
interval, with the exception of 49, the square of the sevenfold, and
its two rectangles 35 and 63. But here the melodic interval 9:10 is ban­
ished, and most of the consonances, except 3:4. It is therefore fortu­
itous, depending on the order of the numbers and the structure of
this diagram.
In vain will the arithmetician seek causes from this direction, in
vain will the Pythagorean be obsessed by his fascination with the seven­
fold, as a counting number: the matter must be pursued more deeply
in geometry, and in the counted and figured numbers, that is to say
in the inconstructible figures themselves, of which the first is the hepta­
gon. For what prevents the possibility of the diagram’s being continued
beyond ten, with the nature of the melodic interval following, is now
no longer the sevenfold, but the other numbers belonging to incon­
structible figures, 9 and 11, which make the rectangle 99, which with
100, the square of the tenfold, makes up an interval which is totally
abhorrent to the nature of melody. So great a difference is there be­
tween axioms of conjecture and axioms of knowledge.
The order of the melodic intervals in perfection, and their names.
We have spoken so far of the origin and order of the intervals which
are less than consonances. Now we must also speak of the differences
between them, and of their names, which we could not keep absolutely
the same as the ancients, since we shall have to differ from them on
these matters and on their causes.
Therefore it is in agreement with what has been said above, espe­
cially Axiom II, that of those intervals which belong to the nature of
the melodic, each one retains the nature of the consonances from which
it is established. Therefore, since of the consonances which are smaller
than the double interval, the most perfect are 2:3 and 3:4, on account
of the nobility of the figures from which they
take their origin, their Joint progeny among the
melodic intervals also, that is to say 8:9, must ------
be elevated above the others. We shall therefore ‘
give this interval, in common with the ancients, the name WHOLE,
and on account of this preeminence, we shall call it a perfect tone,
but on account of the size of the proportion, a major tone.
On the other hand if you compare the greater perfect interval 2:3
with the greater imperfect interval 3:5 on the higher side, or the smaller
of the perfect intervals 3:4 with the smaller of the imperfect intervals
5:6 on the lower side, there will be born from this marriage the rather
imperfect melodic interval 9:10. It is smaller than 8:9; and since that
interval in ancient music before Ptolemy’ "’ was generally not mentioned, inasmuch as the theoreticians demon­
strated all intervals through the full tones pre­
viously defined, we shall give it the name of
minor or little tone, so as to mark its imper­
fection. Here let the reader take note, in a word, that some have given
that name to another interval, so that if he happens by chance to read
them he may not be caught off his guard and confused.
Yet if you link the greater perfect interval 2.'3 with the smaller im­
perfect interval 5-8 on the higher side, or the smaller perfect interval
3:4 with the larger imperfect interval 4:5 on the lower side, the melodic
interval arising from the comparison, that is to say 15:16, again brings in
____ ______ . . _________ _______ an element of im-
perfection from
i s 2 5 :^
the fact that this
is its origin, and
will be called a semitone,^® the same term as is used for this interval
in normal present day music, because it is a little larger than half a
major tone. Some have maintained that it is a minor tone; but the reader
should be wary of them, so as not to be confused.
These three, therefore, arising from perfect intervals by com par­
ison of them either with each other or with imperfect intervals, have
acquired the property of being melodic in their own right and always.
On the other hand if you compare with each other the imperfect
intervals arising from the pentagon or decagon, either on the higher
side 3:5 with 5:8, or on the lower side 4:5 with 5:6, the interval arising
from it, that is to say 24:25, is of such imperfection that it almost ceases
^ ----------
a slackening of the string. Nor am I at pains to
propose by this term the same size of interval
as the ancients: and again let it suffice to give notice of that.’’ There
are three causes of its imperfection: origin, small size (since it does
not equal a third part of a perfect tone), and because it is also listed
among the third intervals above, that is to say among those which are
serviceable for making tuneful kinds of melody. For it also arises from
the comparison of the minor tone and the semitone. Now this interval
is not melodic in its own right nor always; for the human voice does
not usually pass over this interval in one and the same dYCoyfj, “ap­
proach,” as it does the other intervals, but it leaves it out and over­
shoots it, with the sole exception of a modulation in the melody, to

dd flavor. Then it becomes extraordinarily melodic, but in such a
way that it begins, so to speak, a new kind of melody; and it requires
art and no little toil to achieve that with the human voice without an
instrument. Thus this interval only marks the difference between kinds
of melodic intervals, and is serviceable for them on that basis.
We have begun to speak of third intervals; for the same interval
which is the first of them, 24:25 or a diesis, was also the last of the
melodic intervals. There now follow the designations of the remaining
ones. For 128:135 which arises from 15:16 and 8:9 _____
can be designated a major and irregular diesis.
As stated above it is a very little (that is to say
^
by the amount of 2025:2048) smaller than the
^ ^
melodic interval of a semitone and is scarcely distinguished from it.
And under this title it is among the melodic intervals, because it plays
the part of a legitimate diesis, particularly at a modulation in the
melody. For its genesis is both natural and necessary in practice, so
that semitones and dieses are available in all directions, for the sake
of various flavors of melody. For that reason, when a legitimate semi­
tone is split off from a major tone, and this interval remains, we can
designate it too by a Greek name, limma or remainder.
Finally we can call the difference, 80:81, intervening between 8:9
and 9:10, a comma, in Latin a segment or cut. For the ancients cut
their diesis into four parts, and hence called them commas, believing
that this was the common element of all consonances. Now this inter­
val is a little larger than a fourth part of our diesis, and smaller than
a third. For 24:25 is 72:75 or 96:100. Therefore a third part would be
74:75, and a fourth 96:97, about; and 80:81 is between the two. We could
define a comma by a closer number as an eighth part of a major tone,
that is to say 8:9. That is also clear as follows. The major tone 8:9 is
divided into a diesis, 72:75, a semitone, 75:80, and a
24*
comma, 80:81. Now a comma was just found to be $. 7 2 .
about a third of a diesis. Therefore about four commas
are equal to half a tone, and eight to a whole tone,
l 6-
approximately indeed, not absolutely. Therefore this
interval is plainly not among the melodic ones which
P* 8i«
are sung in succession, because their small size is
scarcely perceptible by the hearing, still less expressible in human
melody on their own independently, by two notes in succession. But
it does not cease to be melodic, like 11:12 and similar intervals, be­
cause we are also comparing things which are separated in space and
time. However a double semitone must be established because in the
division of tones which succeed each other in order, two semitones
are sometimes placed in succession; and people occasionally use them
combined together as a tone when they are aiming at variety and novelty,
to express grave disturbances of the mind.
Note that between the semitone 15:16 and the diesis 24:25 there
is 125:128, roughly 42:43 or a double comma. If you add to that a comma 0^81, the result is 625:648, roughly 27:28 or a triple comma. However
the same 80:81 subtracted from a diesis, 24:25, leaves 243:250, which
is as nearly as possible 35:36. The same comma subtracted from a semi-
tone 15:16 leaves a Platonic limma, 243:256, which is roughly 19:20;
but added to 15:16 it makes 25:27 which is between 12:13 and 13:14.
Thus two major tones, 8:9 combined together make 64:81; and it was
by dividing that interval into 3:4 that Plato established his limma. How-
ever on subtracting 243:256 as a limma from a major tone Plato had
as a remainder 2048:2187, which he named an apotome;^*^ and it is
larger by one comma, 80:81, than our limma, 128:135, and exceeds
a semitone, 15:16 very little.
Although these are abnormal intervals, nevertheless mention will
be made of some of them below in Book V.
