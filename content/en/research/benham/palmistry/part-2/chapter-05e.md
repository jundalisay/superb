Color is important in the Heart line as it says whether the subject is warm or cold-hearted.

Press the line from source to termination with the finger. 

Note how the blood flows under this pressure. 

This will indicate the strength of the blood stream and will help to distinguish the color of the line. 

In some lines, the blood flows freely. In others, the whiteness under pressure shows the weak blood supply.


If with the deep, well-cut Heart line we find white color, it will not be so strong an indication of a good physical heart as if the color were pink. We know by the deep line that, while the heart was intended to be of full development, something has taken place, as shown by white color, by which it has been weakened. In such a case look at both hands; if the line colors well in the left and shows white in the right, it will indicate plainly that the naturally strong heart has been impaired and weakened. 

White color in the line of Heart, even if the line is otherwise good, shows the heart's action to be weaker than normal, and the affections colder. With color, always apply it to the type of the subject. Coldness belongs to the Lunarian primarily, the Saturnian second, Mercurian third, while Martians, Apol-lonians, Venusians, and Jupiterians are warm-hearted.

With a white-colored Heart line, apply its coldness to the type of subject, and estimate the result. It will much reduce the strength of the four warmer types, and will make the cold types colder.

With the thin and narrow, broad and shallow, and chained lines, white color exaggerates their cold qualities, and selfishness, vacillation, and fickleness will be exceedingly pronounced, according to which characteristic the line has. Here, again, look at both hands to see if matters are growing better or worse. Pink color will make a deep line operate properly, and all the warmth, steadfastness, and reliability of this good line will be accentuated. If found on the warm types, it will make them strong in the natural directions. If found on the cold types, it will warm them up. Pink color will make a thin line less selfish and narrow; it will make a broad and shallow or a chained line less fickle, and often with these formations pink color is the thing which saves the subject from being entirely inconstant. Red color is the intensity of rich, warm blood, and in the Heart line makes intense all the fires of affection. It shows a heart so strong that it may be dangerous.

On the Martian type we expect it, but it is too strong to be good for any of the others. It is seen on Jupiterians, but is not good on this type. Naturally over-eaters, they tend to apoplexy and heart failure. So a deep red line on a pronounced Jupiterian is indeed a danger signal. Red color in a Martian Heart line will make the affections of the subject intense and his passions great. It will warm up the cold heart of a Lunarian, and make him less selfish. 

The Saturnian yields some of his hate of mankind to red color, while Venusians and Apollonians become too intense. Red color in the deep Heart line will make a strong combination, too intense to be good in many cases. It tends toward excess of this good line, and excess is not desirable. You rarely see red color in thin and narrow, broad and shallow, or chained Heart lines, but when you do, always considerably reduce the estimate of their qualities. Yellow color in the Heart line will tinge the affections with morbidness and will make even the subject with the good, deep line suspicious of those he loves. 

Bile spoils everything, even a good Heart line, and adds its pessimistic view even to love. A yellow Heart line, though it may be deep, is less to be depended upon and is more incline to double dealing than even a white one. Whiteness indicates simply indifference, while yellow color leads to distortion in the manner of looking at things. A yellow Heart line on a strong Saturnian will make as mean a subject as could be found, and it would take very little inducement to make such an one a criminal.

A yellow Heart line on a Mercurian, especially if a bad or an unusually shrewd specimen of the type, would easily make a swindler, and with little encouragement a villain. Yellow Heart lines mean a poisoned, bad heart, so they pull down every type. Blue color in a Heart line tells of the congestion, the sluggish movement of this organ, and the type must at once be located, for if the Apollonian it is serious. Nails must be looked at to see if the trouble is a structural one, or only a defective circulation, the Life line must be examined for any defects which indicate an end to the career, and from this combined point of view, you will be able to estimate how serious the blue Heart line is. You will constantly be called upon to judge whether some marking seen on a Heart line is a health defect, an event in the life, or an indication of character, and this is a point which has puzzled many excellent practitioners. The difficulty is not hard to overcome. The line of Heart indicates, first, the physical state of that organ, and, second, as a result of that physical state, the mental characteristics and qualities of the affections; and, third, it often shows when this mental attitude has taken such hold as to powerfully draw the subject in different directions, causing decided preferences which have led to certain events in his life. 

All of these matters are not shown in every hand. The first and second always are, but the third only at times. As strong brain impressions alone produce changes in the lines, manifestly the third will be seen only in those hands where the brain has been so profoundly impressed that the effect has been transmitted to the lines. If you encounter an unusual formation of the line, or any change from the normal, you wonder whether it is health or character that is indicated. Your first thought should be that it is a health indication, for the line shows, first, the physical condition of the heart. Note the type of your subject, and whether heart disease is a natural defect of this type. If it is, the presumption is strong that the marking is a health defect. 

Next examine the nails, and see if the structural heart-disease formation or blue color at the base be present, and if both or either of these indications are seen, you should be still more strongly convinced that it is a health defect. 

Note the Life line to see if there is any unevenness, whether it breaks, splits, islands, is crossed, and especially if a line runs from the defect on the Heart line to the Life line. If the Life line shows such defects be sure the indication on the Heart line is one which refers to the physical heart. The Saturn line will often show confirmations of a check to the career seen in the Life line by breaking in two or by other defects. The Mercury line, either by stopping at the same age indicated by the defect on the Life line, or by showing some defect, often gives an added confirmation. 

Not finding any of these health defects, it is evident the mark on the Heart line is one showing some characteristic of the affections and not disease. This method must be adopted with every line on which you encounter a change from the normal condition. 

Review everything bearing on disease, first beginning with the health defects of the type to which your subject belongs, and noting in succession nails, color, and all lines that bear any relation to the defect under consideration. Careful practice will in this manner enable you to make a distinction between character and disease. Begin at the starting point of the Heart line, and examine the line along its entire length for defects. These may be splits, crossbars, islands, dots, or breaks. Wherever one of these defects appears, it is either a health indication, or one showing some event connected with the affections. 

The first thing is to examine in the manner above outlined, in order to determine whether ill health is indicated, and if it is, draw your conclusions as to the effect the condition found will have on the affections of the subject. Finding no confirmatory indications of heart difficulty, you turn naturally to other matters. 

The first defect to consider is the split, which you already know how to diagnose. If you find it to be a health defect, it is serious in proportion as it splits the Main line in two and divides the Current, directing part away from its proper channel. Split lines as health defects show a weakened condition of heart with impaired circulation, and the date of the trouble can be read from the line.

As character indications, the place they occur, size of split, and the place to which they run must be guides in reading them. Splits will occur upward or downward according as the split lines rise above or fall below the line. 

All lines which rise from a Main line are more favorable than lines which fall from it, so split lines rising from the Heart line are better indications than those which fall below it. These lines which split from the Heart line will rise to or near a Mount, and will indicate that either the characteristics of the Mount, or someone belonging to that type, so strongly attract the heart as to split off part of the line and draw it up toward the Mount. 

Thus, a split rising from the Heart line under Jupiter (49) will show that ambition will guide love, and the person who will attract this subject will be someone on the Jupiterian order. He does not necessarily have to have money, but he must be prominent, or one who gives promise of rising. 

A split line rising under Saturn (50) will indicate that the subject is attracted by some of the Saturnian qualities. If the subject, on whose hand you find this line, is developed in his mental world, it will be this side of the Saturnian that will attract him, and he will love one who has scholarly attainments. If your client's middle world is strongest, he will love one who has farming, mining, or horticultural aptitudes, or scientific talents. 

If his lower world is strongest, he will love one who has the saving disposition of the Saturnian. In every case this subject will like best one who has the soberness, caution, and wisdom that belong to the Saturnian type. The subject himself may not belong to the Saturnian type, but he will admire these qualities. 

I have seen the most giddy persons with this marking, and believe they realize their need of the Saturnian balance-wheel. A split line rising under Apollo (51) must be reasoned as in the previous case, and your subject will be drawn toward Apollonians. If your subject lives in the mental world, he will love one who is ideally an artist. If the middle world of your subject is strongest, he will love one who is an artist, but he wants this artist able to make money from his art. 

If the lower world is strongest your subject will love one who dresses in a showy fashion and who knows how to make a display. Remember the Apollonian, and that this split line from the line of Heart makes the subject love the qualities of that type; you can carry your explanation as far as you please by describing all that Apollonians are, and saying that this is what your client will love.

If the split line rises to Mercury (52), your subject will love Mercurian qualities. 
- The rule of the upper world of Mercury will show oratory and eloquence
- The rule of the middle world of Mercury is the scientific side
- The rule of the lower world of Mercury is the money-making side
  - The subject will suffer love to be influenced by the amount of money a lover has, or by his ability to make it. 

<!-- If these split lines rise in the centre of the Mounts, read them confidently.  -->

If it seems doubtful on which of 2 Mounts they do end, estimate which one seems most clear and read in this case with some degree of reserve. <!-- Good judgment must be constantly cultivated.  -->

Split lines which fall from the Heart line (53) show a part of the conflict between heart and head, and at the time these lines fall, the head is exerting a very strong influence. 

If, as is often the case, fine lines fall from the Heart line all along its course, there is a perpetual conflict between heart and head for the mastery. These falling lines were read by old palmists to indicate "love-sorrows and disappointments." 

When we think that they do indicate an effort of the head to control sentiment or heart, we can understand how it was reasoned out, for if one loves but allows the head to say that the loved one is not so good a match as someone else, he will have "love-sorrows and disappointments," for calculation (head) has stifled sentiment (heart).

Sometimes a large line will split away from the Heart line and gradually fall to the Head line, merging itself in it (54); this will show that heart has surrendered to head and is thereafter ruled by it. The age at which it begins is shown by the point at which the line splits away, and the complete surrender by the point at which the line loses itself in the line of Head. 

Cross-bars cutting the line (55) are constant heart irritations, either illness, or worries in the affections. On noting them make a search to locate whether they are health defects or whether they apply to the affections. If health defects note how deeply they cut. If only little lines they show temporary heart disturbance of a functional character, if very deep they are more serious; so note all these lines carefully, to see how disastrous they will be in their effect. 

If these cross-bars cut the line in many places, it shows that the trouble is continuous. 

If heart disease, it will show palpitation and valvular difficulties, and generally with such bars present the Heart line grows dim and more defective toward its latter end, and the cross-bars become deeper cut. If these bars do not relate to disease, then constant jars to the affections will be indicated at the age at which these bars show on the line.

All defects on the Heart line are more serious if they appear under the Mount of Apollo. 

Islands in the Heart line (56) are always defects. 
- They obstruct the Current, weaken it, and most often indicate weak physical action of the heart. 
- The size of the island will show how serious the difficulty is. 
- Mere dots are not more than temporary disturbances, while those which are large and deep cut are menaces to life. 

Islands found in the Heart line under the Mounts will generally add a heart complication to some health defect of that Mount type. 

When seen always locate the type of the subject and hunt for a health defect peculiar to him, which if found must have heart weakness added. In this way you are often warned by an island on the Heart line and find back of it additional trouble. 

If chance lines from any other part of the hand run to or near an island on the Heart line, they will give the clue by the place from which they start as to where you should look for information which you can bring to bear on the island. If split lines rise or fall from the Heart line at or near an island these will tell, by the place they end, something about the outcome of the island. When an island is seen, search must be made to ascertain whether it is a health defect, and generally this will be the case. If not, look to location, chance, and other lines for information bearing on some disappointment to the affections. An island on the Heart line under Apollo is always a health indication, and you will seldom fail to get the complete confirmation from nails, etc.

Dots on the Heart line (57) are generally health defects. Their seriousness is gauged by their size. 

When seen, always examine for heart disease. 

If no indication is seen anywhere else, and the dot is small, the case is not serious. The more pronounced the signs of heart trouble which are seen elsewhere, and the larger the dot, the more serious the difficulty.
