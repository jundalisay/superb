THE line of Saturn is the fourth Main line which receives the Current.
- It is also called the "line of Fate"
- It rises at the base of the hand and runs upward
<!-- It may not be obvious why fatality has been ascribed to this line, but the claim is justified in various ways. -->

I hypothesize that the Current from the Life line passes into the Saturn line on its return from the brain.<!--  where it has been sent from the end of the . -->
- Thus, the Saturn line is read from the bottom upward

Its scale indicating the various years of life is in Chapter 4 <!-- (The Age Of The Subject - Age As Indicated On The Lines). -->
- Childhood is the extreme lower part of the line
- Old age is on the Mount of Saturn

The line of Saturn does not indicate health difficulties. <!-- t read, nor is anything shown concerning the general make-up or constitution of a subject such as is indicated in other lines that we have considered. -->

It indicates the course of material success of the subject. It shows:
- whether he will have an easy or <!-- must make his own way, whether he will have --> a hard time<!-- , or whether things will apparently come easy to him. -->
- his most productive periods.

This is why the older palmists named it as the line of "Fate or Destiny" as it is generally indicates luck. <!--  taken for granted that one whose life runs smoothly must have luck in his favor. -->

In these cases it has not always been remembered that such a subject may have had every qualification which would enable him to merit success, and that he has achieved it because he has worked, and because success has been deserved.

Combined with a good line of Saturn, there may be health, brains, determination, ambition, and similar qualities, and in that case the presence of these qualities accounts for the good line of Saturn, which consequently indicates that the subject will get through the world comfortably and successfully.

A combination of such forces as the above, if wisely and faithfully used, produces so-called luck

and most of the persons who are pointed out as particularly fortunate, or lucky, attribute their success primarily to brains, health, energy, ambition, and kindred allies, and not to blind chance, luck, or fate.

There is, however, some magic glamour around the words "fate" and "luck," which seems to speak of results achieved without effort. This has always been the goal of lazy folk.

Such people are ever ready to account for their failures by saying, "Others are lucky, I am not," but this should be followed by the further explanation that most often the "lucky" subject is a worker and the "unlucky" one is not.

Daydreamers expect luck to reach down and touch them with a magic wand.
- Those who are called lucky say that the magic wand is industry.

In many cases, luck consists in having the foresight to seize opportunities.


"Unlucky" persons tell of chances they have passed, and console themselves by saying that luck was not on their side.
- In the majority of cases, it would be more proper to say that foresight and perseverance were not on their side. 

<!-- This much moralizing I beg to introduce here, because I wish it distinctly understood that  -->

I do not believe in blind fate or chance.

<!-- In the beginning of a study of the line of Saturn, or line of Fate, I wish to give my definition of that word and to assure you that we are not to plunge from a treatment of the hand which has thus far proceeded entirely under laws of cause and effect into one which deals with chance. -->

<!-- The line of Saturn is a wonderful line, its revelations are accurate and important, but we shall find causes for all the effects we see upon it. -->


## Periods 

Every line of Saturn is a period when everything is favorable for the subject. 
- These are the harvest periods of his life.

At such times, we find:
- good health
- the presence of mental powers such as discernment, will, ambition
- various good companions which he may use or which he may leave unused.

During these periods, life is easier for the subject.

He is well and in possession of his full powers.
- He works with less effort
- In superstitious talk, he is "lucky" and "fate" is on his side.

Many persons take advantage of these periods of greatest possibilities and "make hay while the sun shines."
- Others pass such times in enjoyment and laziness, confident that "luck is with them," and will never leave.

When the powers begin to wane, luck is no longer so constant.
- It takes more effort to accomplish the same results
- Finally, all kinds of effort fail to produce anything considerable.

At this time, the cry is raised: "luck has gone". 

The truth is that the subject has:
- passed his harvest period
- slept his golden moments away.

He did not seize the opportunities placed before him. 
- He took his pleasure when he should have worked hardest
- By the law of compensation, he must toil to make up for it.

"You cannot eat your cake and have it too"; you cannot waste your harvest days and be "lucky." 

He who has worked through his productive time may rest when powers fail.

The laws of cause and effect are present in the line of Saturn, or Fate, as everywhere else.

<!-- It is only after much observation of this line that it is possible to state what can actually be told from it. The superficiality which has been shown in its treatment has served principally to disgust sensible persons. -->

<!-- Why the line shows these matters, which are so obviously beyond the consciousness of the individual, can only be explained on the already stated hypothesis, that the lines are the life map of every person, placed before him in order that he may be guided to the achievement of his best results. -->

The line of Saturn, when strong, emphasizes the Saturnian traits, especially if the line be deep on the Mount:
- wisdom
- soberness
- seriousness
- energy and frugality
- studiousness and the ability to think

These qualities will do much to make a life successful.

This is why a strong Saturn line indicates <!-- The fact that these balancing qualities are present in some degree with a good line may account for the --> success in old age. 

The Saturnian has a penchant for explorations in the earth. From this natural love, he has been led to discover gold, silver, coal, and other mine treasures.
- He has found gas and oil wells

By following his natural inclinations, " fate " has been said to be with him. <!-- , and the Saturnian has for these reasons been called the "child of fate."  -->

The greatest part that fate or luck plays is to give one person more brains than another. 
- This has been sometimes called the " accident of birth." 

In these cases, the subject will also have the best Saturn line. 

The Apollonian and Venusian, or a good Jupiterian, or Mercurian, are much greater examples to my mind of a kind fate than is the Saturnian. The line of Saturn is not found in every hand. 

Older palmists gave to a hand without a Saturn line the interpretation of a "negative existence." 

It is absent in the hands of many successful people.
- In other prosperous subjects it is present only in rudimentary form. 

<!-- These persons have not led negative lives, so this interpretation cannot be correct.  -->

I have found that 'self-made men' have weak or no Saturn line. 
- They began life in humble positions, and only by dint of energy and application have they made their way in the world. 
- They are not always brilliant to start with, but they have determination and energy and will educate themselves, even if it must be done at night after the day's work is over.
- They will not fail to seize every opportunity for progress. 

They seem to feel that everything depends upon their own efforts and no amount of labor is allowed to stand between them and ultimate success. 

<!-- They are the kind of men who can "carry the message to Garcia." As the result of my observation,  -->

A person with no Saturn line must depend on himself entirely. He should not trust to luck or fortunate circumstances. But if he would accomplish much in the world, it must be the result of his own efforts. 

The Saturn line may start (344) anywhere between the end of:
- the Life line and
- the Mount of Moon. 

Sometimes the line rises inside the Life line, and sometimes as high as the upper Mount of Moon. 

The course of the Saturn line is always toward the Mount of Saturn. 
- Sometimes, it reaches the Mount
- Sometimes, it falls far short. 

It always runs through the centre of the palm. 

When the Saturn line rises inside the Life line and runs on to the Mount of Saturn (345) it indicates that the subject will have material success in life, and that near relatives will assist him greatly.

When the line rises from the centre of the palm (346) and runs into the Mount of Saturn, the subject will achieve success in life largely by his own efforts.

When the line rises from the Mount of Moon and runs on to the Mount of Saturn (347) the subject's success in life will be materially assisted by one of the opposite sex.
- This may either be by good advice or by rendering financial aid.
- This is common in men where the wives have been of great assistance in their career. 

All other starting points are modifications of one or the other of them. 
- All readings should be modified in proportion as the source of the line is from these three pronounced centres. 

Sometimes, the line does not rise low in the hand, but starts higher up (348). 
- In this case the subject will have a more negative existence for the first part of the life, as this point is the time when he is so young that he can accomplish little by his own efforts
- Such a beginning to the line indicates that he was not born with a " silver spoon in his mouth." 

His best period will begin at the time the line starts, for while the absence of the line does not show that influences are at work to prevent the advancement of the subject, the presence of a good line does show that some especial advantages are present during its existence.

- The absence of the line shows that constant effort is needed
- A good line will show that during its best period of formation the greatest efforts should be exerted if the largest results possible are to be achieved.

**The higher in the hand the line starts, the later in life will be the period of easiest sailing.** 

Whenever a deficiency is noted in the Saturn line you will find an explanation in some of the other lines or signs. With the line absent at the beginning, it may be found that the Life line will show great delicacy for the same period of years that is covered by the absence of the Saturn line (349). 

Thus you will know that the subject did little during the earlier years because he was delicate. As the Saturn line begins at the time this delicacy ends on the Life line, he will at that time begin a period which he may make productive. 

If the Life line be thin when it begins to recover, and grows thicker as it progresses, and if the Saturn line does the same, the subject will continue to do better in a business way as his strength increases. 

It will be noted that it is necessary to read the beginning of the Saturn line from the bottom and the Life line from the top. 

If with the line rising late we find a defective Head line at the start (350) the subject will have his start in life impeded by brain weakness, and the Saturn line will not grow good until the Head line does. 

If the Head line be weak at the start, and as soon as it recovers the Heart line become weak, the Life line being thin all of this time (351), the career of the subject will be hindered first by head trouble, and then by heart weakness, and he does not begin to do his best until these have passed away. If the line rise high in the hand and the lines of Head or Heart are not defective, you must look for health defects in other parts of the hand, on lines and Mounts, and somewhere you will discover the cause of the absence of the Saturn line. 

Use both hands with the Saturn line. If the line begin low in the left hand and rise high in the right, you will know that the natural course of the line was favorable, but as it shows its defects in the right hand, something has occurred to alter the original plan. This may be health, laziness, or influences from family, friends, or outsiders, and inasmuch as we do not believe that mere chance has produced the alteration we must look somewhere for the unfavorable condition which has prevented the rising of the Saturn line low in the right hand. 

The absence of a Saturn line where it should normally begin will often be explained by some accident to the parents. <!-- The Line Of Saturn Part 2 495 No. 344. The Line Of Saturn Part 2 496 No. 345. The Line Of Saturn Part 2 497 No. 346. The Line Of Saturn Part 2 498 No. 347. The Line Of Saturn Part 2 499 No. 348. The Line Of Saturn Part 2 500 No. 349. The Line Of Saturn Part 2 501 No. 350. The Line Of Saturn Part 2 502 No. 351.  -->

As this early period of the line covers the childhood of the subject, it will not be through his own fault that the start in life is not as good as it should be. If a line of Saturn rise high in the hand, and a line of parental influence on the Mount of Venus end in a star early in the line (352), the death of a parent has prevented a good start in the life of the subject. Remember all indications on the Saturn line refer to financial affairs. Next in order the character of the Saturn line must be noted. 

If the line be not so deep as the other lines on the hand, the indications peculiar to the line are not in their proper proportions and will not be as strong as if all the lines were in balance. If the line be very deep and clear cut (353), the subject will be found to have exceptionally fine qualities, with a proper use of which he should be enabled to achieve great success. 

If this deep line extend up on to the Mount of Saturn, these favorable conditions will continue during the entire life. If the line be short, they will be present only during the length of the line, the age to be read from the line. If this deepness of the line be early in life, the subject will have his best period during childhood (354). 

This is an unfortunate marking, for at this age the subject is seldom old enough to take advantage of opportunities. 

<!-- The Line Of Saturn Part 3 503 No. 352 The Line Of Saturn Part 3 504 No. 353. The Line Of Saturn Part 3 505 No. 354. The deep line of Saturn is the most favorable line to possess.  -->

A thin line (355) will show that the subject has much in his favor in the way of natural advantages, and while he will have to exert himself more to bring forth great results than a subject with a deep line, he will still have an easier time to succeed than one with a defective line or with no line at all. 

A broad and shallow line (356) indicates a condition little better than no line at all, and if the Saturn line alone be of such a character, while the other lines are well marked, the subject will have continual struggles. A chained line of Saturn indicates that the career will be a hard one. 

If the line be chained, during its entire length, the subject will have continuous obstructions and the life will be a labored one, full of disappointments (357). If chained only part of the way, the difficulties will last during this condition. The Line Of Saturn Part 3 506 No. 355. The Line Of Saturn Part 3 507 No. 356. 

The Line Of Saturn Part 3 508 No. 357. 

Color indicates the strength and condition of the Blood Current. 
- It does not affect the line of Saturn, as it does other lines. 
- This is because this line is not an index of the health or the disease of the subject.<!-- , and thus the line of Saturn will be the first line to which it is unnecessary to apply the color test.  -->
