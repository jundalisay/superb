71. NOAH (Nuh)

We sent Noah to his people: “Warn your people before there comes upon them a painful punishment.”

2. He said, “O my people, I am to you a clear warner.
3. Worship Allah and reverence Him, and obey me.
4. And He will forgive you of your sins, and
reprieve you until a stated term. Allah’s term
cannot be deferred once it has arrived, if you
only knew.”
5. He said, “My Lord, I have called my people
night and day.
6. But
my call added only to their flight.
Whenever I called them to Your for-
giveness, they thrust their fingers into their
ears, and wrapped themselves in their gar-
ments, and insisted, and became more and
more arrogant.
7.
I called them openly.
Then I appealed to them publicly, and I
spoke to them privately.
10. I said, ‘Ask your Lord for forgiveness; He is
Forgiving.
11. He will let loose the sky upon you in tor-
rents.
9.
14. Although
He created you in stages.
you not realize that Allah created seven
heavens in layers?
16. And He set the moon in their midst for
light, and He made the sun a lamp.
17. And Allah germinated you from the earth
like plants.
18. Then He will return you into it, and will
bring you out again.
15. Do
19. And
1.
8. Then
12. And provide you with wealth and children,
and allot for you gardens, and allot for you
rivers.
13. What is the matter with you, that you do
not appreciate Allah’s Greatness?
Allah made the earth a spread for you.
20. That
you may travel its diverse roads.’”
said, “My Lord, they have defied me,
and followed him whose wealth and children
increase him only in perdition.”
21. Noah
22. And they schemed outrageous schemes.
they said, “Do not give up your gods;
do not give up Wadd, nor Souwa, nor
Yaghoos, and Yaooq, and Nassr.

24. They have misled many, so do not increase the wrongdoers except in confusion.”
25. Because of their wrongs, they were drowned, and were hurled into a Fire. They
did not find apart from Allah any helpers.

26. Noah said, “My Lord, do not leave of the unbelievers a single dweller on earth.
27. If You leave them, they will mislead your servants, and will breed only wicked unbelievers.
28. My Lord! Forgive me and my parents, and anyone who enters my home in faith, and all
the believing men and believing women; and do not increase the wrongdoers except in perdition.”
