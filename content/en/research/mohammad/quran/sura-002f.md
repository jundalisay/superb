168. O people! Eat of what is lawful and good on earth. Do not follow the footsteps of Satan, an open enemy. 169. He commands you to:
- do evil and vice
- say about Allah what you do not know.

Satan's followers will say:  
170. <!-- And when it is said to them, “Follow what Allah has revealed,” they say, --> “We follow what we found our ancestors following.” 

This is even if their ancestors understood nothing, and were not guided. 

171. The parable of those who disbelieve is that of someone who calls upon someone who
hears nothing except screaming and yelling.

Deaf, dumb, and blind—they do not understand.

172-173. Muslims, <!--  Eat of the good things We have provided for you, and give thanks to
Allah, if it is Him that you serve. --> Allah has forbidden you carrion, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and what was dedicated to other than Allah. But if anyone is compelled, without desiring or exceeding, he commits no sin.

174. Those who conceal what Allah revealed in the Book, and exchange it for a small price—
those swallow nothing but fire into their bellies. And Allah will not speak to them on the
Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them,
and they will have a painful punishment.

175. It is they who exchange guidance for error, and forgiveness for punishment. But why do
they insist on the Fire?

176. That is because Allah has revealed the Book in truth; and those who differ about the
Book are in deep discord.

177. Righteousness does not consist of turning your faces towards the East and the West. 

But righteous is he who believes in Allah, and the Last Day, and the angels, and the Scripture, and the prophets. 

The sincere and pious are those who:
- give money, though dear, to near relatives, orphans, the needy, homeless, beggars, and for the freeing of slaves
- perform the prayers
- pay the obligatory charity
- fulfill their promise when they promise
- patiently persevere in the face of persecution, hardship, and conflict. 

178. Muslims,  Retaliation for the murdered is ordained upon you. 

The free for the free, the slave for the slave, the female for the female. 

But if he is forgiven by his kin, then grant any reasonable demand, and pay with good will. 

This is a concession from your Lord, and a mercy. 

But whoever commits aggression after that, a painful torment awaits him.

179. There is life for you in retaliation, O people of understanding, so that you may refrain.

180. It is decreed for you: when death approaches one of you, and he leaves wealth, to
make a testament in favor of the parents and the relatives, fairly and correctly—a duty upon the righteous.

181. But whoever changes it after he has heard it, the guilt is upon those who change it.

182. Should someone suspect bias or injustice on the part of a testator, and then reconciles
between them, he commits no sin. 

183. Muslims,  Fasting is prescribed for you, as it was prescribed for those before you, so that you may become righteous.

184. For a specified number of days. 

But whoever among you is sick, or on a journey, then a number of other days. 

For those who are able: a ransom of feeding a needy person. 

But whoever volunteers goodness, it is better for him. But to fast is best for you.

185. Ramadan is the month in which the Quran was revealed. 

Guidance for humanity, and clear portents of guidance, and the Criterion. 

Whoever of you witnesses the month, shall fast it. But whoever is sick, or on a journey,
then a number of other days. Allah desires ease for you, and does not desire hardship for you, that you may complete the number, and celebrate Allah for having guided you, so that you may be thankful.

186. When My servants ask you about Me, I Am near; I answer the call of the caller when he calls on Me. So let them answer Me, and have faith in Me, that they may be rightly guided.

187. Sex with your wives on the night of the fast is allowed. 

They are a garment for you, and you are a garment for them. 

Allah knows that you used to betray yourselves, but He turned to you and pardoned you. 

So approach them now, and seek what Allah has ordained for you, and eat and
drink until the white streak of dawn can be
distinguished from the black streak. 

Then complete the fast until nightfall. 

But do not approach them while you are in retreat at the mosques. 

These are the limits of Allah, so do not come near them. Allah thus clarifies His
revelations to the people, that they may attain piety.

188. Do not consume one another’s wealth by unjust means, nor offer it as bribes to the officials in order to consume part of other
people’s wealth illicitly, while you know. 

189. They ask you about the crescents. Say, “They are timetables for people, and for the
Hajj.” It is not virtuous that you approach homes from their backs, but virtue is to be pi-
ous. 

So approach homes from their doors, and observe Allah, that you may succeed.
