How do the inhabitants of Earth see the face of their heaven as wholly like that of ours?

First, they must see the body marked S as completely full of light and like our sun, given that that body sends rays from all points of its surface toward their eyes.

Because it is much closer to them than the stars, it must appear much greater to them. The parts of the small heaven ABCD that turns about the earth offer some resistance to those rays. But, because all the parts of the great heaven that are between S and D strengthen the rays, those that are between D and T, being comparatively small in number, can take away only very little of their force from them. 

Even all the action of the parts of the large heaven FGGF does not suffice to impede the rays of many fixed stars from reaching to the earth from the side on which it is not illuminated by the sun.

Solar systems can be rather unequal in size. But they must always be exactly of the same force so that all the matter that is in the line SB must tend as strongly toward ε as that which is in the line εB tends toward S. For, if they do not have that equality among them, they will most certainly be destroyed in a short time, or at least they will change until they have acquired it.

The whole force of the ray SB is just exactly equal to that of the ray εB. The force of the ray TB (which is less) cannot impede the force of the ray εB to extend to T. In the same way, the star A can extend its rays to the earth T, in as much as the matter of the heaven between A and 2 aids them more than that between 4 and T resists them, and in addition in as much as that between 3 and 4 aids them no less than that between 3 and 2 resists them. 

Thus, judging others proportionately, those stars must appear no less confusedly arranged, nor less in number, nor less unequal to one another, than do those we see in the real world.

But you must still consider in regard to their arrangement that they can just about never appear in the true place where they are. For example, that marked e appears as if it were in the straight line TB, and the other marked A as if it were in the straight line T4.

This is because the heavens are unequal in size. The surfaces that separate them are just about never so disposed that the rays that pass through them to go from the stars toward the earth meet them at right angles. 

When the rays meet them obliquely, it is certain, according to what has been demonstrated in the Dioptrics,[62] that there they must bend and undergo a great deal of refraction, in as much as they pass much more easily through one side of this surface than through the other. 

Those lines TB, T4, and ones like them are so extremely long compared to the diameter of Earth's orbit around the sun. This makes the Earthlings always see the stars as fixed in the firmament. This is why astronomers say that they cannot observe parallax in the stars.[63]

<!-- Regarding the number of those stars, consider also that  -->

### Gravitational Lensing 

The same star can often appear in different places because of the different surfaces that divert its rays toward the earth. 

Point `A` appears in the line `T4` by means of the ray `AT` and simultaneously in the line `Tf` by means of the ray `A6fT`. In the same way are the objects multiplied that one looks at through glasses or other transparent bodies cut along several faces.

Stars appear much smaller than they are because of their extreme distance. This is why:
- most of them must not appear at all
- others appear only insofar as the rays of stars joined together render the parts of the firmament through which they pass a bit whiter. This is similar to:
  - the stars which astronomers call "nebulous," or
  - the great belt of our heaven that the poets pretend to be whitened by the milk of Juno.[64] 

Despite this, the less distant stars are about equal to our sun<!-- , in order to judge that they can appear as large as the largest of our world -->.

Generally, all the bodies that send out stronger rays against the eyes of onlookers than do the bodies surrounding them appear proportionately that much greater than they. Consequently, those stars must always seem larger than the parts of their heavens that are equal to them and that neighbor them. 

The surfaces `FG`, `GG`, `GF` and ones like them, where the refractions of [the stars'] rays take place, can be curved in such a way that they greatly increase [the stars'] size; indeed, even when completely flat, they increase it.

Moreover, it is very probable that 

Those surfaces are in a matter that is very fluid and that never ceases to move. They should always shake and quiver.  Consequently, the stars one sees through them should appear to scintillate and vibrate, just as ours do. This makes them <!-- , and even, because of their vibration, --> appear a bit larger. 

In this way, the moon appears larger when viewed from the bottom of a calm lake which is rippled by some wind. <!--  of which the surface is not very stirred up or agitated, but merely a bit rippled by the breath of some wind. -->

Over time, those surfaces change a bit, or even that some of them bend rather noticeably in a short time, even if this is only on the occasion of a comet's approaching them. This makes several stars seem after a long time to change a bit in place without changing in size, or to change a bit in size without changing in place. Indeed, some even begin rather suddenly to appear or to disappear, just as one has seen happen in the real world.[65]

The planets and the comets are made up of the <!--  that are in the same heaven as the sun, knowing that the parts of the --> aethreal earth which have parts <!-- of which they are composed are --> so large or so joined severally together that they can resist the action of light. 

This makes them appear to Earthlings through the rays of sunlight beubg <!--  by means of the rays that the sun sends toward them and that are --> reflected. <!-- from there toward the earth --> <!--  just as the opaque or obscure objects that are in a room can be seen there by means of the rays that the lamp shining there sends toward them and that return from them toward the eyes of the onlookers.  -->

The rays of the sun have a quite noteworthy advantage over the light of a lamp. 
- It consists in their force's being conserved, or even being increasingly strengthened to the degree that they move away from the sun, until they have reached the exterior surface of its heaven, because all the matter of that heaven tends there. 

By contrast, the rays of a lamp are weakened:
- as they move away, in proportion to the size of the spherical surfaces they illuminate and
- by the air resistance which they pass. 

This makes the objects close to that lamp noticeably more lit by it than those far from it. But this does not apply to our solar system. The planets near the sun are not more lit by the sun than the farthest planets or the comets<!-- , which are incomparably more distant -->.

<!-- The same thing also happens in the real world. I do not believe, however, that it is possible to give a reason for it if one supposes that light is anything in the objects other than an action or disposition such as I have set forth.  -->

<!-- I say an action or disposition; for, if you have attended well to what I have just demonstrated, to wit, that,  -->

If the space where the sun is were totally void, then the parts of its heaven would not cease to tend toward the eyes of onlookers in the same way as when they are pushed by its matter (and even with almost as much force). <!-- , you can well judge that --> there is just about no need to have any action in the sun itself nor just about even for it to be anything other than pure space in order to appear as we see it. 

This might seem paradoxical. 

The rotation <!-- motion those --> of the planets<!--  have about their center is the reason why --> makes then twinkle, but much weaker and in another way than the fixed stars do. The moon does not rotate and so it does not twinkle. <!--  is deprived of that motion, it does not twinkle at all. -->

As for the comets that are not in the same heaven as the sun, they are far from being able to send out as many rays toward the earth as they could if they were in the same heaven, not even when they are all ready to enter it. Consequently, they cannot be seen by men, unless perhaps when their size is extraordinary. 

This is because most of the rays that the sun sends out toward them are borne away here and there and effectively dissipated by the refraction they undergo in the part of the firmament through which they pass. 

For example, whereas the comet `CD` receives from the sun, marked `S`, all the rays between the lines `SC` and `SD` and sends back toward the earth all those between the lines `CT` and `DT`,[66] one must imagine that the comet `EF` receives from the same sun only the rays between the lines `SGE` and `SHF` because, since they pass much more easily from S to the surface GH (which I take to be a part of the firmament that they cannot pass beyond), their refraction there must be very great and very much outward. 

This diverts many of them from going toward the comet `EF`, given first of all that this surface is curved inward toward the sun, just as you know it should curve when a comet approaches it. But, even if it were completely flat, or even curved in the other direction, most of the rays that the sun sent out to it would not cease to be impeded by the refraction, if not from going up to it, at least from returning from there to the earth. For example, if one supposes the part IK of the firmament to be a portion of a sphere of which the center is at `S`, the rays `SIL` and `SKM` should not bend there at all in going toward the comet LM; 

by the same token, however, they should bend greatly in returning from the comet toward the earth, so that they can reach the earth only very feebly and in very small quantity. Beyond that, since this can happen when the comet is still rather far from the heaven that contains the sun (for otherwise, if it were close to that heaven, it would cause the heaven's surface to curve inward), its distance also impedes it from receiving as many rays as when it is ready to enter the heaven. As for the rays it receives from the fixed star at the center of the heaven containing it, it cannot send them back toward the earth any more than the moon, being new, can send back those of the sun.

But, what is even more noteworthy regarding those comets is a certain refraction of their rays, which is ordinarily the reason why some of them appear about [the comets] in the form of a tail or of a curl.[67] 

You will easily understand this if you cast your eyes on this figure, where 

Let:
- `S` be the sun
- `C` be a comet
- `EBG` be the sphere that made up of those parts of the aethereal air that are the largest and least agitated of all
- `DA` be the Earth's orbit

Imagine the ray coming from `C` toward `B` passes straightaway to point `A`. It begins at point `B` to grow larger and to be divided into many other rays, which extend every which way in all directions. 

Thus, each of them is that much weaker as it is carried farther away from the one in the middle, `BA`, which is the principal ray of all and the strongest. Then, too, when the ray CE is at point `E`, it begins to grow larger and also to be divided into many others, such as `EH`, `EY`, `ES`. 

The principal and strongest of these, however, is `EH`, and the feeblest is `ES`. In the same way, `CG` passes principally from `G` toward `I`, but in addition it is also carried away from `S` and toward all the spaces between GI and `GS`. 

Finally, all the other rays that can be imagined between those three rays `CE`, `CB`, and `CG` hold more or less to the nature of each of them, according as they are more or less close. To this I might add that they should be a bit bent toward the sun; but that is in fact not necessary for my purposes, and I often omit many things in order to render those I do explain that much simpler and easier.	

<!-- Now, this refraction having been supposed, it is manifest that,  -->

When the earth is at `A`, not only should the ray BA cause men on it to see the body of comet `C`, but also the rays `LA`, `KA`, and others like them, which come to their eyes more feebly than `BA`, should cause to appear to them a crown or curl of light uniformly spread out in all directions around the comet (as you see at the place marked 11), at least if they are strong enough to be perceived. 

They can often be strong enough coming from comets, which we suppose to be very large, but not coming from planets, or even from fixed stars, which one must imagine to be smaller. It is also manifest that, when the earth is at M and the comet appears by means of the ray CKM, its curl should appear by means of QM and all the other rays tending toward M, so that it extends farther than before in the direction opposite to the sun, and less far or not at all toward the person looking at it, as you can see here at 22.

Thus appearing longer and longer on the side opposite the sun, to the degree that the earth is farther away from point A, it little by little loses the shape of a curl and is transformed into a long tail, which the comet trails behind it. For example, when the earth is at D, the rays QD and VD make it appear like 33. And, when the earth is at O, the rays VO, EO, and others like them make it appear still longer. 

Finally, when the earth is at Y, one can no longer see the comet because of the interposition of the sun; however, the rays VY, EY, and others like them do not cease to cause its tail still to appear in the shape of a chevron or of a torch, such as here at 44. And one should note that, since the sphere EBG is not always exactly round, nor also any of the others it contains (as is easy to judge from what we have set out), those tails or torches should not always appear exactly straight, nor in fact in the same plane as the sun.

The refraction that causes all of this is of a nature very special and very different from all those commonly observed elsewhere. 

<!-- But you will not fail to see clearly that it should take place in the manner I have just described to you if you consider that the  -->

Ball H, being pushed toward I, also pushes toward I all those below it down to K, but that the latter, K, being surrounded by many other smaller balls, such as 4, 5, and 6, only pushes 5 toward I, and meanwhile pushes 4 toward L and 6 toward M, and so on. 

Nevertheless, it does so in such a way that it pushes the middle one, 5, much more strongly than the others, 4, 6, and those like them which are on the sides. In the same way, the ball N, being pushed toward L, pushes the small balls 1, 2, and 3, one toward L, the other toward I, and the other toward M; but with this difference, that it pushes 1 the most strongly of all, and not the middle one, 2. 

Moreover, the small balls 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., being thus all pushed at the same time by the other balls N, P, H, P, impede one another from being able to go in the directions L and M as easily as toward the middle, I. Thus, if the whole space LIM were full of similar small balls, the rays of their action would be distributed there in the same manner as I have said are those of the comets within the sphere EBG.

If to this you object that the inequality between the balls N, P, H, P and 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. is much greater than that which I have supposed between the parts of the second element that compose the sphere EBG and those that are immediately below them toward the sun, I respond that one can draw no other consequence from this than that there should not take place as much refraction in the sphere EBG as in that composed by the balls 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. 

However, since there is in turn some inequality between the parts of the second element that are immediately below this sphere EBG and those that are still lower toward the sun, this refraction increases more and more as the rays penetrate farther. 

Thus, when the rays reach to the sphere of the earth DAF, the refraction can well be as great as, or even greater than, that of the action by which the small balls 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. are pushed. 

For it is very likely that the parts of the aethereal air toward this sphere of the earth DAF are no less small in comparison with those toward the sphere EBG than are those balls 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. in comparison with the other balls N, P, H, P...

## Footnotes

[1] sentiment. It is difficult to render this word into English with full precision. Descartes' own parenthetical explication -- "idea that is formed in our imagination through the intermediary of our eyes" --is of limited help, since at the time of writing The World he had not yet worked out the details of his metaphysics or theory of mind. But it does place sentiments in the mind and makes them more than merely the sensory data connoted by "sensations". Moreover, in Man the brain has sentiments not only of heat and of the color red (note the judgment involved), but also of pain, tickling, and taste. Hence, the term covers both sensations caused by external objects and feelings originating within the body; in an example soon to follow a soldier who mistakenly thinks himself wounded in battle "senses" [sent] both pain and a strap. The mind's involvement in a sentiment tempts one to translate it by "perception", especially since the French cognate does not appear either in The World or in Man. However, it does occur in the Principles of Philosophy and in the Passions of the Soul. The latter includes sentiment among several different sorts of perception. Perception in a general sense is any thought that does not result from the action or will of the soul, and in a restricted sense is "evident knowledge"; sentiment is "what is received in the soul in the same way as objects of the external senses and is not otherwise known by the soul" (Passions, I, 28; AT.XI.349). Perceptions may arise in the imagination, in which case their objects do not really exist. Sentiments arise in the body by the intermediary of the nervous system and, whether really or only apparently, involve the body's external senses. Since here in The World it is the external senses and their relation to the external world that Descartes is discussing, "sensation" seems the best English equivalent.

[2] Like all university-educated people of his day, Descartes was as fluent in Latin as he was in his native tongue. Not having to translate Latin discourse to understand it, he might well have been unable later to recall in what language he had heard or read something.

[3] For the theory of mind underlying this argument, see Rule XII of Rules for the Direction of the Mind and Man (AT.XI.170ff.).

[4] Galileo used this example of the feather drawn lightly over the skin to make roughly the same point about sensory data; see his Assayer (1624), Chap. 48.

[5] In Discourse I of the Dioptrics Descartes adds to this list of light sources the eyes of cats and other animals that can see in the dark.

[6] I have added quotation marks here to reflect Descartes' belief that these Aristotelian terms are merely names signifying nothing real.

[7] Cf. Aristotle, Physics, III, 2, 202a, where in addition the mover must be in contact with the moved.

[8] Here Descartes hints for the first time that the measure of force in his world is the product of size and speed. The hint never becomes an explicit statement, however, and "size" is later used ambiguously; see below, n.50 .

[9] Discourse II, "Of Refraction:" "It is only necessary to note that the power, whatever it be, which causes the movement of this ball to continue is different from that which determines it to move in one direction rather than in another, . . ." (Descartes= Discourse on Method, Optics, Geometry, and Meteorology, trans. P.J. Olscamp, Indianapolis, 1965, p.75). On the distinction, which Descartes discusses in greater detail in Chapters 7 and 13 below, see the analyses of A.I. Sabra, Theories of Light from Descartes to Newton (London, 1967), Chapters I-IV, and M.S. Mahoney, The Mathematical Career of Pierre de Fermat (Princeton, 1973; 2nd ed. 1994), App. II.

[10] Here Descartes invokes for the first of several times a principle of natural economy for which he provides no justification. He states it most clearly below, p. 46= "When nature has many ways of arriving at the same effect, she most certainly always follows the shortest." Neither the nature of matter nor the conserving action of God, both soon to be introduced as the basic principles of the physical universe, seems to imply that nature always takes the most direct path.

[11] Descartes develops the mechanism for these sensations in Man; cf. AT.XI.143-144.

[12] en action de. Action acquires a technical meaning in Chap. VII, where Descartes introduces and explains the laws of motion; cf. below, n. 37. But the phrase as used here seems to mean no more than that the balls are in continuing contact and not, as in the next paragraph, touching one another only in passing, i.e. in contact for an instant and no more.

[13] eaux fortes. F. Alquié, Descartes. Oeuvres philosophiques (Paris, 1963ff), I, 328, n.3, identifies these "strong waters" as nitric acid, used at the time especially for etching copper plates.

[14] This removal of any upper limit to the size of a part, combined with the absence of any lower limit (cf. Chap. V on the first element), distinguishes Descartes' theory of matter from other atomist and corpuscularist theories, all of which posited a finite, but imperceptibly small size for the ultimate constituents of matter.

[15] See Rule XII of Rules for the Direction of the Mind, AT.X.424.

[16] For examples of such "experiments" from the works of the fourteenth-century philosophers Albert of Saxony, Jean Buridan, and Marsilius of Inghen, see Edward Grant (ed.), Source Book in Medieval Science (Cambridge, MA, 1974), 324-328. For later writers, see Charles B. Schmitt, "Experimental Evidence for and against a Void= The Sixteenth-Century Arguments", Isis 58(1967), 352-66.

[17] The argument here employs unstated premises to achieve a reductio ad absurdum of the theory that vacua exist but that nature "abhors" them. First, it is argued that machines lift great weights before breaking because for, say, a beam to break would require the creation (at least for an instant) of a vacuum between its ruptured parts. But, if so, how could air contain interstitial vacua and still have any body at all (which its resistance to motion through it shows it does)? Why would it not simply dissipate? Second, it is argued that in pumps the water rises against its natural inclination in order to prevent the formation of a vacuum as the piston is withdrawn. But, if so, then why would the water not fall naturally from the clouds to fill interstitial vacua in the air below?

[18] This motion of mutual replacement is quite reminiscent of Aristotle's antiperistasis, mentioned in Physics IV, 8, 215a, as one possible mechanism for the continued motion of projectiles. Aristotle uses it, however, not to account for motion in a plenum, but to argue against the existence of a vacuum.

[19] Descartes here again posits a principle of natural economy for which he offers no independent justification; cf. above, n.10. Its application here contravenes the results of his earlier research in hydrostatics while conforming to arguments to be made later (below, Chap. XIII) about the propagation of light through the second element.

[20] Here the first element assumes the properties of the mathematical continuum. There are no atoms in Descartes' world, just a fragmented continuous space. Cf. above, n.14.

[21] In traditional Aristotelian cosmology, the four elements were themselves compounds of the terms, taken two at a time, of two pairs of contrary "principles" or qualities= hot--cold and wet--dry. Fire was hot and dry, air hot and wet, water cold and wet, and earth cold and dry. The compositions were often displayed schematically in the form to the right.  Reference to the principles here leads to Descartes' statement of his mechanistic program and emphasizes what a radically different approach that program represents. Rather than serving as explanatory constituents of the elements, the principal qualities must be explained in terms of the nature and behavior of those elements.	
[22] Hence, differing only by size and speed, all elements are transformable into one another merely by change of size or speed.

[23] Descartes retains here some vestige of the Aristotelian doctrine of natural place. It is no less justified by his argument so far than is his assumption of three elementary states of matter.

[24] It would seem to follow from Descartes' principles that mixed bodies exist along the surfaces of all the planets. In restricting his claim to the surface of the earth, he may have been reflecting his uncertainty about the theological acceptability of a plurality of (possibly inhabited) worlds.

[25] Cf. Edward Grant, "Medieval and Seventeenth-Century Conceptions of an Infinite Void Space beyond the Cosmos," Isis, 60(1969), 39-60.

[26] It is perhaps worth asking here whether Descartes might be hinting at the distinction between a boundless space and an infinite one. On an ocean-covered, spherical earth the surface water, though finite in area, nonetheless appears endless through the absence of any boundaries.

[27] Descartes here appeals without further explication to his doctrine of clear and evident ideas.

[28] See below, p.19 , for some elucidation of this remark. There Descartes insists on at least half of the identification of space and matter, i.e. that the essential property of matter is to take up space. Although the arguments just presented against the void would seem to complete the identification, note that God creates matter in an already existing space of indefinite extent.

[29] Here cosmogony and cosmology are reduced to the same mechanism.

[30] But, "[We cannot be sure] . . . that He cannot do what we cannot understand; for it would be temerity to think that our imagination is as extensive as His power." Descartes to Mersenne, 15.IV.30, AT.I.14.

[31] Descartes set out the "others" in the Principles of Philosophy; see below, n. 39.

[32] Descartes repeats here in somewhat different terms the critique he made in Rule XII of Rules for the Direction of the Mind.

[33] Aristotle, Physics, III, 1, 201a.

[34] Although Descartes here places rest and motion on the same ontological level, it is not until the Principles of Philosophy that he argues the relative nature of motion; cf. Principles, Pt. II, pars. 24 and 25.

[35] Since Descartes has nowhere given quantitative meaning to "motion," it must remain unclear what is being transferred here and what governs that transfer.

[36] When finally published in the Principles, the rules of impact derived from the laws of motion indeed were "manifestly contrary" to empirical data, as critics immediately pointed out. Descartes anticipated the criticism in Pt. II, par. 53 by noting how difficult it was to single out the bodies involved in any real exchange of motion. He expanded this defense in a letter to Clerselier in February 1645 (AT.IV.183-188) and added to it another version of his principle of economy= When two bodies, which have in them incompatible modes [of motion], collide, some change must certainly take place in these modes to render them compatible, but . . . this change is always the least possible." True to his word in The World, Descartes steadfastly refused to accept empirical evidence against his laws of motion, and several of his followers took an equally stubborn stance after his death.

[37] Note the determinative role of mathematics in this argument.

[38] Cf. above, n.12; Here the phrase en action de seems to preserve its meaning, although action has picked up (p. 23 ) the technical sense of inclination to move." So later, for example, light is an action; Chap. XI sets out the properties of the action by which [men's] eyes can be thus pushed [to see light],"but it establishes no parameters by which it might be measured.

[39] The rules are contained in pars. 45-52 of Part II of the Principles; for a handy schematic presentation, see E.J. Aiton, The Vortex Theory of Planetary Motions (New York, 1972), 36.

[40] Sapientia, VIII, 21. The statement was a commonplace of medieval thought and was encountered by every schoolboy in the opening line of Johannes de Sacrobosco's Algorismus vulgaris, the standard arithmetic textbook from the mid-thirteenth to the mid-sixteenth century.

[41] To compound the vagueness of the measure of "motion," Descartes here seems to suggest a non-linear gradient of motion in the vortex, though he offers no reason for it.

[42] Here again is the non-linear variation of orbital speed with respect to radial distance.

[43] Descartes shifts here from explication of the mechanism to illustration of it by analogy with more familiar phenomena.

[44] Compare this explanation with Descartes' theory of the tides, below, Chap. XII.

[45] The nature and location of the three comets observed in 1618 became the focal issues in an acrid debate between Galileo and the Jesuit astronomer Orazio Grassi. The debate triggered Galileo's masterful Assayer (1624), in which he defended empirical investigation and the use of mathematics and the telescope at the samxtime that he argued that comets were little more than atmospheric optical illusions. For the central texts of that debate, see S. Drake and C.D. O'Malley (trans.), The Controversy on the Comets of 1618 (Philadelphia, 1960).

[46] In order= Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Earth, Venus, Mercury.

[47] This shift from volume to surface as a measure of a body's magnitude only further confuses the question of the parameters of "motion" or "force."

[48] The surface varies as the square of the ball's radius, the volume as its cube. Hence, the ratio of surface to volume varies as 1/radius. And so, it decreases while the radius increases.

[49] Here again a principle of natural economy substitutes for a missing mechanism; cf. above, n. 10.

[50] Foremost among the new astronomers, of course, was Galileo, who first reported the moons of Jupiter in his Starry Messenger (1610). Later that year he observed what he thought were satellites about Saturn; he mentioned them in the dedication of his Floating Bodies (1611) to Cosimo II of Tuscany.

[51] Descartes here introduces the void as a counterfactual hypothesis. He employs the same device later in explicating his theory of light; cf. below, Chap. XIII.

[52] Descartes had clearly never been down to any depth himself nor talked to anyone who had. Nonetheless, one would think that his hydrostatical investigations and his knowledge of those of Stevin and Beeckman would have compensated for the absence of direct experience. The replacement principle just invoked here is the obverse of Archimedes' famous principle that a body immersed in a fluid loses as much weight as the weight of the fluid displaced.

[53] This paragraph in particular shows the necessity of the earth's motion in Descartes' universe.

[54] Compare this and the following chapter to Discourses I and II of the Dioptrics, for which they supply the real model of light.

[55] It is important to follow the construction of the diagram here, and hence to modify it. Strictly speaking E is a point, the apex of the visual cone EAD. By taking a neighborhood of points about E, Descartes generates a space, which he also calls E. The light coming to that space is the light contained in all the visual cones having a vertex in the space and a base in the sun, i.e. it is the light contained in the truncated cone FADG, where F and G should lie at the upper corners of the space, as shown in the following figure:

The whole argument seems motivated solely by the need to have a person's eye at E see the whole disk of the sun.

[56] Here again the counterfactual use of the void introduced above; cf. n. 51.

[57] The principle of economy again; cf. n.10.

[58] Compare the "packing" argument to follow with the analogy of the wine vat in Discourse I of the Dioptrics.

[59] Note the virtue of conceiving of light as a force or tendency to move rather than as a motion.

[60] Discourse II of the Dioptrics.

[61] On the relation of the real model of light (an impulse propagated instantaneously through a medium) and the heuristic model used in the Dioptrics (a tennis ball moving through empty space), see M.S. Mahoney, The Mathematical Career of Pierre de Fermat (Princeton, 1973, 2nd ed. 1994), App. II.

[62] Discourse I.

[63] Thus Descartes removes perhaps the strongest empirical argument against the Copernican system. If, that is, the earth makes an annual circuit about the sun at a distance sufficient to account for observed planetary phenomena, observations of the fixed stars made from opposite sides of the orbit ought to differ by some amount. No one had been able to ascertain any difference, nor would anyone do so until the nineteenth century. Descartes joined Galileo and other defenders by arguing away the point with reference to the immense distance of the fixed stars.

[64] Among the startling telescopic discoveries announced by Galileo in his Copernican works of the 1610s was the composition of the Milky Way; magnification revealed it to consist of a huge number of separate stars.

[65] The novae or "new stars" observed in 1572 and 1604 had much to do with the spread of Copernicanism and of opposition to it.

[66] Note the sloppiness of Descartes' mathematics here. C and D cannot be common points of tangency unless T coincides with S. The error makes clear how little of Descartes' argument in fact rested on mathematical reasoning.

[67] In the Assayer (trans. Drake in Drake and O'Malley, Controversy (see n.45), 190), Galileo describes the phenomenon as a "curl" [chioma]; Descartes' term is chevelure, which literally means "head of hair."
