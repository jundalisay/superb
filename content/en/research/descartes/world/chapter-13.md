Bodies that revolve always tend to move away from the centers they revolve from. <!--  of the circles they describe.  --> But what direction do the stars and heavens tend towards?

<!-- Here, however, I must determine more specifically in what directions the parts of the matter of which the heavens and the stars are composed do tend.[54] -->

## Cartesian Inertia as Inherent Motion 

A body that 'tends' towards some direction does not mean that there is a thought or desire inside the body that carries it there. Instead, it means that:

- It is **disposed** to move there and
- There is something <!-- , whether it truly moves or, rather, some other body --> **preventing** it. <!-- It is principally in this last sense that I use the word "tend," because it seems to signify some effort and because --> 
'Tend' here means that the body is doing an effort to counteract such a <!-- resis  presupposes some --> resistance. 

**The body thus tends towards different directions at the same time according to different points of view.** 

There are often diverse causes that act together on the same body. 
- These impede each other's effect.
- The same body can be thought of as tending in different directions at the same time. 

Thus, the parts of the aethereal earth have 3 movements or tendencies:

1. **They move away from the center** [of the aethereal earth in totality] when they are considered:
  - all alone*
  - as opposed to other parts of the earth that make up more massive physical bodies  <!-- than they are -->
2. **They move closer to its center** when one considers the force of the aethereal air <!--  parts of the heaven --> pushing them there
2. **They move away from bodies** due to the influence of other bodies [in the background].  
<!-- when one considers the force of the aethereal air -->

For example:

<!-- , if we consider only its agitation all alone. -->

1. The stone would tend toward `E` if both the resistance of the sling and the [background] agitation from other bodies are negated.

2. But it would tend circularly from `A` to `B`, if `D` existed and the **the length** of its sling regulated and determined the motion of the stone.

3. The stone turning in a sling along the circle `AB` will tend toward `C` from point `A` if it were agitated [by other bodies]. 
<!-- alone [without `D`] with its -->

<!-- , without considering the part of its agitation of which the effect is not impeded, one opposes the other part of it to the resistance that this sling continually makes to it. -->


### 3. Inertia from the Background Influence of Other Bodies

Imagine the inclination this stone has to move from `A` toward `C` as if it were composed of 2 other inclinations:

1. One sought to turn along the circle `AB`
2. Another sought to go along the line `DY`
<!-- `VXY` -->

Imagine the inclinations were in the following ratios:

Position of Sling | Position of Stone
--- | ---
A | A
B | C
F | G

Thus, the stone would always be along line `ACG`.

 <!-- a proportion that, if the stone were at the place of the sling marked `A` `V`  when the sling was at the place of the circle marked `A`, it should thereafter be at the place marked X when the sling is at B, and at the place marked Y when the sling is at `F`, and thus should always remain in the straight line `ACG`.  -->

<!-- - Then, knowing that one of the parts of its inclination (to wit, that which carries it along the circle AB) is in no way impeded by the sling, you will easily see that the stone meets resistance only for the other part (to wit, for that which would cause it to move along the line `DVXY` if it were not impeded).  -->


### 2. Inertia Without the Influence from a Second Body

If there were no sling, the stone, with the agitation that would move it along the circle `AB`, would move along the path `DXY`.

<!-- - Then, knowing that one of the parts of its inclination (to wit, that which carries it along the circle AB) is in no way impeded by the sling, you will easily see that the stone meets resistance only for the other part (to wit, for that which would cause it to move along the line `DVXY` if it were not impeded).  -->

### 1. Inertia Without Influence

Consequently, it tends (makes an effort) only to move directly away from the center `D`. 

From this point of view, when the stone is at `A`, it tends truly toward `E` [because it is tending to move away from `D`].

It is not at all more disposed to move toward `H` than toward `I`. Although one could easily persuade oneself of the contrary if he failed to consider the difference between:
- the motion that it already has [unaffected by other bodies not D] and 
- the inclination to move that remains with it [from D].
