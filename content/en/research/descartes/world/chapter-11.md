What is the weight of this earth? 

There is a force that unites all its parts and that makes them all tend toward its center, according to its size and solidity.

The parts of the <!-- small heaven --> aether surrounding it turns much faster than its parts about its center. This also causes them to move away with more force from its center and consequently to push the parts of the earth back toward its center.

The most massive and solid bodies, such as comets, tend to move outward towards the circumferences of the system. 

Only the less massive and less solid ones are pushed back toward their centers. 

Only the less solid parts of the earth could be pushed back toward its center. The others move away from it. 

The most solid and most massive bodies tended to move away from the center of any heaven, I supposed that they were already previously moving with the same agitation as the matter of that heaven. 

If they have not yet begun to move, or if they are moving less fast than is required to follow the course of this matter, they must at first be pushed by it toward the center about which it is turning. 

The larger and more solid will be pushed with more force and speed. 

Nevertheless, if they are solid and massive enough to compose comets, this does not hinder them from tending to move shortly thereafter toward the exterior circumferences of the heavens, in as much as the agitation they have acquired in descending toward any one of the heavens' centers will most certainly give them the force to pass beyond and to ascend again toward its circumference.

The earth `EFGH` with water `1234` and air `5678` are composed of some of the less solid of the earth's parts and constitute a single mass with it. 

The matter of the heaven, which fills not only all the space between the circles `ABCD` and `5678` but also all the small intervals below it among the parts of the air, the water, and the earth.

Heaven and this earth turn together about center `T`, all their parts tend to move away from it, but those of the heaven much more quickly than those of the earth, because the former are much more agitated. 

Among the parts of the earth, those more agitated in the same direction as those of the heaven tend more to move away from the center than do the others. 

"Void" means the space that is filled only with a matter that could not resist the actions of other bodies nor produce any considerable effect.

Thus, if the whole space beyond circle `ABCD` were void then all the parts of the system in the circle ABCD would be the first to leave it then those of the air and of the water would follow them, and  finally also those of the earth, each that much sooner as it were less attached to the rest of its mass.[51] 

In the same way:
- a stone leaves a sling in which it is being moved as soon as one releases the cord
- the dust one throws on a top while it is turning immediately flies off from it in all directions.
	
Since there is no such space beyond circle `ABCD` that is void and where the parts of the heaven contained within that circle can go, unless at the same instant others completely like them enter in their place, the parts of the earth also cannot move away any farther than they do from center T, unless there descend in their place just as many parts of the heaven or other terrestrial parts as are needed to fill it. 

Nor, in turn, can they move closer to the center unless just as many others rise in their stead. Thus they are all opposed to one another, each to those that must enter in its place in the case that it should rise, and similarly to those that must enter therein in the case that it should descend, just as the two sides of a balance are opposed to one another. 

Just as one side of a balance can be raised or lowered only if the other side does exactly the contrary at the same instant and just as the heavier always raises the lighter, so too the stone R, for example, is so opposed to the quantity (exactly equal in size) of air above it, whose place it should occupy in the case that it were to move farther away from center T, that that air would necessarily have to descend to the extent that the stone rose.

In the same way, it is also so opposed to another, like quantity of air below it, whose place it should occupy in the case that it were to move closer to that center, that the stone must descend when this air rises.

This stone has much more of the matter of the earth than a quantity of air of equal extent. Consequently, it contains much less of the matter of the heaven. 

Its terrestrial parts are less agitated by the matter of the heaven than those of that air. 

The stone therefore should not have the force to rise above that quantity of air. On the contrary, the quantity of air should have the force to make the stone fall downward. 

Thus, that quantity of air is light when compared with the stone but is heavy when instead it is compared with the wholly pure matter of the heaven. 

Thus, each part of terrestrial bodies is pressed toward T, not indifferently by the whole matter surrounding it, but only by a quantity of this matter exactly equal to the size of the part; that quantity, being underneath the part, can take its place in the case that the part falls. 

This is why, among the parts of any single body designated "homogeneous" (such as among those of air or water), the lowest are not notably more pressed than the highest, and why a man down below in very deep water does not feel it weigh on his back any more than if he were swimming right on top.[52]

It might seem that the matter of the heaven, in thus causing the stone R to fall toward T and below the air surrounding it, should also cause it to go toward 6 or toward 7 (i.e. toward the occident or toward the orient) faster than this air, so that the stone does not fall in a straight, plumb line as heavy bodies do on the real earth. 

If so, consider first that all the terrestrial parts contained in the circle `5678`, in being pressed toward `T` by the matter of the heaven in the way I have just explained, and having in addition very irregular and diverse shapes, must join together and approach one another and thus compose only one mass, which is borne as a whole by the course of the heaven `ABCD`.

Thus, while the mass turns, those of its parts that are, say, at 6 always remain opposite those that are at `2` and at `F`, without notably moving aside one way or the other except insofar as winds or other particular causes constrain them to do so.

Note moreover that the little heaven `ABCD` turns much faster than the earth, but that those of its parts that are caught in the pores of terrestrial bodies cannot turn notably faster than those bodies about the center T, even though those parts move much faster in diverse other directions, according to the disposition of these pores.

Even though the matter of the heaven makes the stone R move closer to that center (because the matter tends to move away from it with more force than the stone), the matter nevertheless cannot force the stone to back up toward the occident, even though the matter also tends with more force than the stone to go toward the orient. To see this, consider that this matter of the heaven tends to move away from the center T because it tends to continue its motion in a straight line; but it tends to move from the occident toward the orient only because it tends to continue its motion at the same speed and because it is moreover indifferent toward being at 6 or at 7.

The matter moves a bit more in a straight line while causing the stone R to fall toward T than it does in leaving the stone at R; but it could not move as fast toward the orient if it caused the stone to move back toward the occident as it could if it left the stone in its place or even if it pushed the stone before it.

Even though this matter of the heaven has more force to cause this stone R to descend toward T than to cause the air surrounding the stone to descend there, it should nevertheless not have more force to push the stone before it from the occident toward the orient, nor consequently to cause the stone to move faster in that direction than the air. 

To see this, consider that there is exactly as much of this matter of the heaven acting on the stone to cause it to fall toward T (and using its full force to that end) as there is matter of the earth in the composition of the stone's body and that, in as much as there is much more matter of the earth in the stone than in a quantity of air of equal extent, the stone must be pressed much more strongly toward T than is that air. 

By contrast, to cause the stone to turn toward the orient, all the matter of the heaven contained in circle R acts on it and conjointly on all the terrestrial parts of the air that is contained in that same circle. Thus, there being no more acting on the stone than on this air, the stone should not turn faster than the air in that direction.

Many philosophers use arguments to refute the motion of the real earth. This has no force against the motion of the earth I am describing to you.

For example, they say that if the earth moved, then:
- heavy bodies could not descend in a plumb line toward its center, but rather would have to depart from it every which way toward the heaven
- cannonballs fired toward the West should travel much farther than if pointed toward the East
- we should always feel great winds in the air and hear great noises

These and like things do not take place except when we suppose that the earth is not carried by the course of the heaven surrounding it, but that it is moved by some other force and in some other direction than that heaven.[53]
