The parts of the matter are very diverse. Most of them take the form of the aethereal fire or the aethereal air from breaking and dividing by collision with one another.

Nevertheless, among them are two sorts that had to retain the form of the third element:

1. Those which had shapes so extended and so impeding that, when they collided with one another, it was easier for them to join together. This allows them to become larger instead of breaking up and becoming smaller. 
2. Those which began as the largest and most massive of all, could well break and shatter the others by striking them, but not be shattered themselves.

Whether these two were initially agitated or not, they afterwards had to move with the same agitation as the aether that contained them. <!-- matter of the heaven -->
- If they were moving faster than the aether, then   then, not having been able to avoid pushing it upon colliding with it in their path, in a short time they had to transfer to it a part of their agitation. 
- If they were not moving, they were surrounded everywhere by the aether <!-- that matter of the heaven -->. They necessarily had to follow the aether, just as boats <!-- and diverse other bodies floating on water (both the largest and most massive and those that are less so) --> follow the water they are in. <!--  when there is nothing else to impede them from doing so.[43] -->


Massive and solid bodies that float on water always have much more force than the water. This allows them to continue their motion, even though they get their motion from the water alone. An example are the largest and most heavily-laden boats. 

By contrast, the very light floating bodies, like those lumps of white scum floating along the shores during storms, have less force to continue moving.

If you imagine two rivers that join at some point and then separate again before their waters have a chance to mix. 
- Rapid, heavy boats from River A will will be easily able to pass into River B. 
- slow, light boats from River A will turn away from River B and will be thrown back by the force of the water toward the places where it is the least rapid.

<!-- (which one must suppose to be very calm and to have a rather equal force, but also to be very rapid) ,  -->

<!-- then boats or other rather massive and heavy bodies that are borne by the course of the one river , while the lightest bodies  -->

For example, River 1 is ABF and River 2 is CDG. They come from two different directions and meet at E and then turn away from there. AB goes towards F. CD goes towards G. 
- Boat H in River 1 starts from A towards B passses through E towards G. 
- Reciprocally, Boat I in River 2 starts from C and goes towards F.

If both both meet at the passage E at the same time, the larger and stronger boat will break the smaller and weaker. 

By contrast, lighter bodies such as leaves and feathers that float at A are pushed by the course of the water, not toward E and toward G, but toward B, where the water is less strong and rapid than at E.

, since at B it takes its course along a line that less approaches a straight line.

These light bodies, but also others heavier and more massive can join upon meeting and that, turning then with the water that bears them, several together can compose large balls such as you see at K and L, of which some, such as L go toward E and others, such as K, go toward B, according as each is more or less solid and composed of more or less large and massive parts.

Wherever the parts of matter that could not take the form of the aethereal fire or the aethereal air may have been at the beginning, all the larger and more massive among them shortly had to take their course toward the outside circumference of the heavens that contained them and thereafter pass continually from one of these heavens into another without ever stopping for a very long period of time in the same heaven. 

By contrast, all the less massive had to be pushed, each toward the center of the heaven containing it, by the course of the matter of that heaven. And (given the shapes that I have attributed to them) upon colliding with one another, they had to join together severally and compose large balls which, turning in the heavens, have there a motion tempered by all the motions the separate parts could have if they were in fact separate. 

Thus, some tend to move toward the circumferences of those heavens, and others toward their centers.

Those that tend to range toward the center of any heaven to be the planets, and we should take those that pass across different heavens to be comets.

There are a few comets in the aethereal world compared to the number of heavens. 

If there were many at the beginning, over the course of time in passing across different heavens almost all of them would have to have collided with one another and broken one another up (just as I have said two boats do when they meet), so that now only the largest could remain.

When comets pass from one heaven into another, they always push before them some small bit of the matter of the heaven they are leaving and remain enveloped by it for some time until they have entered far enough within the limits of the other heaven. 

Once there, they finally loose themselves from it almost all at once and without taking perhaps more time to do so than does the sun in rising at morning on our horizon. In this way, they move much more slowly when they thus tend to leave some heaven than they do shortly after having entered it.


For example, the comet that takes its course along the line CDQR, has already entered rather far within the limits of the heaven FG.

Nevertheless, when it is at point C still remains enveloped by matter from the heaven FI, from which it comes, and cannot be entirely freed of that matter before it is around point D. 

But, as soon as it has arrived there, it begins to follow the course of the heaven FG and thus to move much faster than it did before. Then, continuing its course from there toward R, its motion must again slow down little by little in proportion as it approaches point Q, both because of the resistance of the heaven FGH, within the limits of which it is beginning to enter, and because, there being less distance between S and D than between S and Q, all the matter of the heaven between S and D (where the distance is smaller) moves faster there, just as we see that rivers always flow more swiftly in the places where their bed is narrower and more confined than in those where it is wider and more extended.[44]

This comet should be visible to those who live at the center of the heaven `FG` only during the time it takes to pass from `D` to `Q`, as you will soon understand more clearly when I have told you what light is. 

In the same way, you will see that its motion should appear to viewers to be much faster, its body much greater, and its light much brighter, at the beginning of the time they see it than at the end.

if you consider with some care the way in which the light that can come from the comet must spread out and be distributed in all directions in the heaven, you will also be well able to understand that, being very large (as we must suppose it to be), there can appear around it certain rays that sometimes extend in the form of a halo on all sides and sometimes gather together in the form of a tail on one side only, according to the different places from which it is viewed. m us, this comet lacks none of all the properties that have been observed up to now in those that have been seen in the real world, at least none of those properties that should be taken as true. 

In order to construct a miracle that warns of the <!-- crescent --> arrival of the Turks, some historians tell us that in the year 1450, the moon was eclipsed by a comet which passed below it. 

The astronomers attributed it to the parallax among the planets. 

<!-- , calculating badly the amount of refraction (which they do not know) of the heavens and the speed of motion of comets (which is uncertain), attribute to them enough , or even below them (where some wish to pull them as by force), then we are not obliged to believe them.[45]
