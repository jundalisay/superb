Section 6: Personal Identity
The Self is a Collection of Perceptions
Some philosophers imagine:

that we are always intimately conscious of our self,
that we feel its existence and its continuance, and
that we are certain of its perfect identity and simplicity.
They say that:

the strongest sensation, the most violent passion:
fixes the self the more intensely, and
makes us consider their influence on the self by their pain or pleasure, instead of distracting us from the self.
we cannot prove this further, since if we doubt something so intimate as the self, then we cannot be certain of anything.
Unluckily, all these assertions are contrary to our experience of the self.

If we continued this reasoning, then we cannot have any idea of the self.
From what impression could the idea of the self be derived?
This question is impossible to answer without a contradiction and absurdity.
Yet we must answer this for the self to be a clear and intelligible idea.
Every real idea comes from an impression.
But the self or person is not any one impression.
It is an impression that references our several other impressions and ideas.
If any impression creates the idea of self, that impression must continue invariably throughout our lives, since the self is supposed to exist for a lifetime.

But no impression is constant and invariable.
Pain and pleasure, grief and joy, passions and sensations succeed each other.
They never all exist at the same time.
Therefore, the idea of the self cannot be derived from any impressions.
Consequently, there is no such idea of the self.
What must become of all our perceptions on this hypothesis?

All these:
are different, distinguishable, separable from each other,
may be separately considered,
may exist separately, and
do not need anything to support their existence.
How do they belong to the self?
How are they connected with it?
When I enter most intimately into myself, I always stumble on some perception of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure.

I can never:
catch myself at anytime without a perception, nor
observe anything but the perception.
When my perceptions are removed for any time, as by sound sleep, I may truly be said not to exist as long as I am insensible of myself.
I would be entirely annihilated if all my perceptions were removed by death.
I could neither think, feel, see, love, nor hate after the dissolution of my body.
I could not conceive what is needed to make me a perfect non-entity.
If anyone seriously thinks he has a different notion of himself, then I cannot reason with him.

He may be correct, just as I am correct.
But we are essentially different in this:
He may perceive something simple and continued, which he calls himself.
Though I am certain there is no such principle of him in me.
The rest of mankind is nothing but a bundle or collection of different perceptions which:

succeed each other with an inconceivable rapidity, and
are in a perpetual flux and movement.
The Mind is a Theatre Where Perceptions Live
Our eyes cannot turn in their sockets without changing our perceptions.

Our thought is still more variable than our sight.
All our other senses and faculties contribute to this change.
There is no single power of the soul which remains unalterably the same, perhaps for one moment.
The mind is a kind of theatre where several perceptions successively make their appearance.
Perceptions pass, re-pass, glide away, and mingle in an infinite variety of postures and situations.
There is no simplicity in it at one time.
There is no identity in different times, whatever natural propension we may have to imagine that simplicity and identity.
The comparison of the theatre must not mislead us.
They are the successive perceptions only that constitute the mind.
We do not have the most distant notion of:
the place where these scenes are represented,
the materials it is composed of.
What then gives us so great a propension to:

ascribe an identity to these successive perceptions, and
suppose ourselves having an invariable and uninterrupted existence through our lives?
To answer this question, we must distinguish between personal identity regarding:

our thought or imagination, and
our passions or our concern for ourselves.
The Idea of Identity is Caused by the Resemblance of Perceptions
Our idea of the personal identity which produces thought or imagination can be explained by our idea on the personal identity of plants and animals.

There is a great analogy between:
the personal identity of plants and animals which produces thought or imagination, and
the personal identity of a person.
We have a distinct idea of an object that remains unchanged through time.

We call this idea 'identity' or 'sameness'.
We also have a distinct idea of several related objects existing in succession.
This gives us a perfect a notion of 'diversity', as if those objects were not related.
These two ideas of 'sameness' and 'diversity' are perfectly distinct and even contrary.
Yet in our common way of thinking, they are confounded with each other.
The action of the mind that comes up with the idea of sameness and the idea of diversity feels almost the same.

The effort required in both is the same.
But the similarity of the successive objects in our idea of diversity makes us consider it as one continued object.
This resemblance is the cause of the confusion and mistake.
It makes us replace the diversity of objects with the notion of identity.
We might properly think of the object as different for a split second.
But in the next moment, we always assign an identity to that object.
Our propensity to this mistake is so great.

We fall into it before we are aware.
We incessantly correct ourselves by reflection return to a more accurate method of thinking.
Yet we cannot sustain our philosophy for long, or take off this bias from the imagination.
Our last resource is to yield to it.
We boldly assert that these diverse but related objects are the same.
In order to justify this absurdity to ourselves, we often feign some new and unintelligible principle that:
connects the objects together, and
prevents their interruption or variation.
Thus, we feign the continued existence of the perceptions of our senses, to remove the interruption.

We run into the notion of a soul, self, and substance to disguise the variation.
If we did not do so, our propension to confound identity with relation would be so great.
We would imagine [Footnote 10] something unknown and mysterious, connecting the parts, beside their relation.
This is the case with the identity that we ascribe to plants.
Even when this does not take place, we still feel a propensity to confound these ideas, even if we:
are not able fully to satisfy ourselves in that, nor
can we find anything invariable and uninterrupted to justify our notion of identity.
Footnote 10:

If the reader wants to see how a great genius may be influenced by these seemingly trivial and vulgar principles of the imagination, let him read my Lord Shaftsbury's reasonings on:
the universe's uniting principle, and
the identity of plants and animals (See his Moralists, or Philosophical Rhapsody).
Thus the controversy on identity is not merely a dispute of words.

When we improperly ascribe 'identity' to diverse objects, our mistake is not confined to the idea of identity.
It is commonly attended with a fiction of something:
invariable and uninterrupted, or
mysterious and inexplicable, or
at least with a propensity to such fictions.
This hypothesis is proven by showing from daily experience that diverse objects which continue the same, are only those that have parts successively connected by resemblance, contiguity, or causation.

When our minds perceive such a succession in objects, we assign it a notion of diversity.
We only ascribe identity to it by mistake.
The relation of the parts of the object which leads us into this mistake, is merely a quality which makes our minds easily easy transition from one to another.
The error arises only because of the resemblance which this act of the mind on thinking about a noncontinuous object bears to the act of the mind thinking about a continuous object.
Our chief business then is to prove that all objects that we think as having an identity, are objects that have a succession of related objects, without observing their lack of change and lack of continuity.
We Assign a Change in Identity Based on Our Perception of the Change Relative to the Whole
A mass of matter with contiguous and connected parts, is placed before us.

We attribute a perfect identity to this mass, provided all the parts are unchanged.
But if some very small part were added to or subtracted from the mass, it would absolutely destroy the whole's identity, strictly speaking.
Yet we seldom think so accurately.
We say the mass is the same despite this trivial change.
The thought passes so smoothly and easily from the object before the change to the object after it.
We do not perceive the transition.
We imagine that it is just a continued survey of the same object.
A very remarkable circumstance attends this experiment.

The change of any considerable part in a mass of matter destroys the whole identity.
But we must measure the greatness of the part by its proportion to the whole, and not absolutely.
The addition or reduction of a mountain would not be enough to produce a diversity in a planet, but the change of a very few inches can destroy the identity of some bodies.
This means that objects break or interrupt the continuity of the mind's actions not according to the size of the objects, but according to their proportion to each other.
This interruption makes an object cease to appear the same.
The uninterrupted progress of the thought which constitutes the imperfect identity.
This may be confirmed by another phenomenon.

A change in any considerable part of a body destroys its identity.
But it is remarkable that where the change is produced gradually and insensibly, we are less apt to ascribe to it the same effect.
The only reason is that when the mind follows the successive changes of the body:
it feels an easy passage from surveying its condition in one moment to the view it in another, and
it perceives no interruption in its actions.
From this continued perception, it ascribes a continued existence and identity to the object.
We might use precautions in:
introducing the changes gradually, and
making them proportional to the whole.
We make a scruple of ascribing identity to such different objects, when the changes finally become considerable.

We may induce the imagination to advance a step further by producing a:
reference of the parts to each other, and
combination to some common end or purpose.
A ship, with a big part changed by frequent repairs, is still the same ship.
The difference of the materials does not hinder us from ascribing an identity to it.
The common end, in which the parts conspire:
is the same under all their variations, and
affords an easy transition of the imagination from one bodily situation to another.
But this is still more remarkable when we:

add a sympathy of parts to their common end, and
suppose that they bear to each other the reciprocal relation of cause and effect in all their operations.
This is the case with all plants and animals.

Their several parts have a:
reference to some general purpose, and
mutual dependence on, and connection with each other.
Tree

After a few years, both plants and animals undergo a total change.

Yet we still ascribe identity to them, while their form, size, and substance are entirely altered.
This is the effect of so strong a relation.
An oak that grows from a small plant to a large tree is still the same oak.
Though none of its parts are the same.
A baby becomes a man.
He is sometimes fat or lean without any change in his identity.
Two phenomena are remarkable:

1. We are commonly able to distinguish between numerical and specific identity.

Yet sometimes we confound them.
In our thinking and reasoning, we employ the one for the other.
A man who hears a sound that is frequently heard on and off, says that it is still the same sound even if those sounds only resemble each other.

Those sounds are not numerically the same.
Only the source that produced those sounds is numerically the same.
A brick church falls to ruin.

The parish rebuilds the same church of stone, according to modern architecture.
The form and materials are not the same.
The only common to the two objects is their relation to the people of the parish.
Yet this alone is enough to make us call them the same.
In these cases, the initial object is destroyed before the latter object comes into existence.

Our minds do not get more than one impression of the object at a time.
This is why we call them the same.
2. In order to preserve the identity in a succession of related objects, the change of its parts should not be sudden nor entire.

Yet where the objects are, by nature, changeable, we allow a more sudden transition.
A river is constantly in motion and changing its parts.

A river might totally change in a day.
But it stays the same for several ages.
We expect whatever is natural and essential to anything.

We get a weak impression from observing what is expected.
This breaks the continuity of the thought very little, and has less influence in destroying the identity.
We get a stronger impression from observing the unusual and extraordinary.
This breaks the continuity of the thought more, and has more influence in destroying the identity.
The Idea of Personal Identity is Caused by the Resemblance and Causation of Perceptions
We now explain the nature of personal identity.

Recently in England, this has become so great a question of ill philosophy.
England is where all the more abstruse sciences are studied with ardour and application.
We shall continue the method of reasoning which we successfully applied to explain the identity of plants, animals, ships, houses, and all the compounded and changeable productions of art or nature.
The identity we ascribe to the mind of man, is only a fictitious one.

It is similar to the identity we ascribe to plants and animals.
Therefore, it has the same origin and comes from the similar operation of the mind.
The identity which we attribute to the human mind is not able to:

run the several different perceptions into one, nor
make them lose their essential characters of distinction and difference
Every distinct perception that enters into the mind's composition is a distinct existence.

It is different, distinguishable, and separable from every other perception, either contemporary or successive.
This identity of the mind means the unity of that mind's perceptions.
Does this identity really bind our several perceptions together?
Or does it only associate the ideas created by the perceptions in the imagination?
When we mention a person's identity, do we observe some real bond among his perceptions?
Or do we feel a bond with the ideas that we create from our perception of his perceptions.
We can easily answer this question if we remember that:

the understanding never observes any real connection among objects, and
even the union of cause and effect, when strictly examined, resolves itself into a habitual association of ideas.
It follows that identity does not really belong to these different perceptions and does not unite them together.

Personal identity is merely a quality which we attribute to those different perceptions, because of the union of their ideas in our imagination, when we think about them.
The only qualities which can unify ideas in the imagination, are the relations of resemblance, contiguity and causation.
These are the uniting principles in the ideal world.
Without them, every distinct object would:
be separable by the mind, and
appear totally unconnected with any other object.
Therefore, identity depends on some of these three relations.
The very essence of resemblance, contiguity and causation is in their creation of an easy transition of ideas.
It follows that our notions of personal identity come entirely from the smooth and uninterrupted progress of the thought along a train of connected ideas.
The only question which remains is: which relations produce this uninterrupted progress of our thought when we consider the successive existence of a mind or thinking person?

We must confine ourselves to resemblance and causation, and drop contiguity because it has little influence in this case.
Resemblance Leading to Personal Identity
We would best see a resemblance in a person's perceptions if we could:

see into his heart,
see the successive perceptions in his mind, and
see his memories of most of his past perceptions.
The memory is just a faculty which we bring up the images of past perceptions.

An image necessarily resembles its original object.
The frequent placing of these resembling perceptions in the chain of thought:
convey the imagination more easily from one link to another, and
makes the whole seem like the continuance of one object.
In this case, the memory not only discovers the personal identity.
It also contributes to produce the identity by producing resemblance among the perceptions.
The case is the same for ourselves or others.
Causation Leading to Personal Identity is Sourced from Memory
Impressions of reflection

The human mind is a system of different perceptions or existences linked together by cause and effect.

This system allows perceptions to mutually produce, destroy, influence, and modify each other.
Our impressions give rise to their correspondent ideas.
These ideas in turn produce other impressions.
One thought chases another and draws after it a third, by which it is expelled in its turn.
I can only compare the soul to a republic with several members united by the reciprocal ties of government and subordination.

This gives rise to other persons who propagate the same republic through constant change.
The same republic may change its members, laws, and constitutions.
Similarly, a person may vary his character, disposition, impressions and ideas, without losing his identity.
Whatever changes he endures, his parts are still connected by causation.
Our identity is directed by our feelings to corroborate with causation in our imagination:
by making our distant perceptions influence each other, and
by giving us a present concern for our past or future pains or pleasures.
We are acquainted with the continuance and extent of this succession of perceptions through our memory alone.

Memory is the source of personal identity.
Had we no memory we would never have any notion of causation.
Consequently, we would have no chain of causes and effects to create our idea of the self.
After we have acquired this notion of causation from the memory, we can extend the same chain of causes.

Consequently, we can extend the identity of ourselves beyond our memory.
We can then comprehend times, circumstances, and actions, which have existed but we have entirely forgotten.
How few of our past actions can we remember?
Who can tell me what were his thoughts and actions on:
January 1, 1715,
March 11, 1719, and
August 3, 1733?
Can he say that his present self is not the same person with the self of those times because he has entirely forgotten the incidents of these days?
He will overturn all the established notions of personal identity if he does this.
Therefore, memory does not so much produce as discover personal identity, by showing us the relation of cause and effect among our different perceptions.

Those who affirm that memory produces entirely our personal identity, should explain why we can extend our identity beyond our memory.
This whole doctrine leads us to a very important conclusion that all the nice and subtle questions on personal identity can never possibly be answered.
They are more grammatical than philosophical difficulties.
Identity depends on the relations of ideas.
These relations produce identity through that easy transition.
The relations and the transition's easiness may reduce insensibly.
We have no just standard to decide any dispute on when they acquire or lose the name of 'identity'.
All the disputes on the identity of connected objects are merely verbal, except so far as the relation of parts creates some imaginary principle of union.
The first origin and uncertainty of our notion of the human mind's identity, may be extended with little or no variation to the origin of simplicity.

An object, whose different co-existent parts are bound together by a close relation:
operates on the imagination in the same way as one perfectly simple and indivisible, and
does not require a much greater stretch of thought to its conception.
From this similarity of operation we:

attribute a simplicity to it, and
feign a principle of union as:
the support of this simplicity, and
the center of all the different parts and qualities of the object.
We have finished our examination of the philosophical systems of the intellectual and natural world.

In our miscellaneous way of reasoning, we have been led into several topics.
These will:
illustrate and confirm some preceding part of this discourse, or
prepare the way for our following opinions.
We will now:

return to a closer examination of our subject
proceed in the accurate anatomy of human nature, having fully explained the nature of our judgment and understandings.
