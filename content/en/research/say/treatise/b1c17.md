## Digression on the Balance of Trade

The 'balance of trade' is the comparison a nation makes between the value of its exports to, and that of its imports from, foreign countries, 
- If it has exported more than it has imported, then it has to receive the difference in gold and silver
- The balance of trade is then said to be in its favour.
- When the case is reversed, the balance is said to be against it.


The exclusive system proceeds upon these maxims:

1. The commerce of a nation is advantageous, in proportion as its exports exceed its imports, and as there is a larger cash balance receivable in specie, or in the precious metals= watch-cases, spoons, forks, dishes, coffee-pots; or rolled out into leaves for the embellishment of picture frames, bookbinding, and the like; in which case, they form part of that portion of the capital of the community, which yields no interest, but is devoted to the production of utility or pleasure.

It is doubtless an advantage to the nation, that the material, whereof this portion of its capital consists, should be cheap and abundant. The enjoyment they afford in these various ways is then obtained at a lower rate, and is more widely diffused. 

There are many establishments on a moderate scale, which, but for the discovery of America, would have been
unable to make the show of plate that is now seen upon their
tables. But this advantage must not be over-rated; there are
other utilities of a much higher order. The window-glass, that
keeps out the inclemency of the weather, is of much more
importance to our comfort, than any species of plate whatso-
ever; yet no one has ever thought of encouraging its import
or production by special favour or exemptions.

2. Through duties, prohibitions, and bounties, the government can make that balance more in favour of, or less
against, the nation.

These two maxims must be analysed minutely in the first place;
then, let us see what is the course of practice.
When a merchant sends goods abroad, he causes them to be
there sold, and receives, by the hands of his foreign correspondents, the price of his goods, in the money of the country. If he expects to make a profit upon the return cargo, he causes that price to be laid out in foreign produce, and remitted home to him. 

The operation is with little variation the same, when he begins at the other end; that is to say, by mak-
ing purchases abroad, which he pays for by remitting domestic products thither. These operations are not always executed
on account of the same merchant.

It sometimes happens that the trader, who undertakes the outward, will not undertake the homeward adventure. 

In that case he draws bills payable after date, or upon sight, upon his correspondents, by whom
the goods have been sold; these bills he sells or negotiates, to
somebody, who sends them to the place they are drawn upon,
where they are made use of in the purchase of fresh goods,
which the last mentioned person imports himself. 150

The other utility of the precious metals is, to act as the material of money, that is to say, of that portion of the national
capital, which is employed in facilitating the interchange of existing values between one individual and another. 

For this purpose, is it any advantage that the material selected should
be abundant and cheap? 

Is a nation, that is more amply provided with that material, richer than one which is more scantily supplied?

In both cases, one value is exported, another value is im-
ported in return; but we have not to stop to inquire, if any part
of the value either exported or imported consisted of the pre-
cious metals. It may reasonably be assumed, that merchants,
when left the free choice of what goods they will speculate
in, will prefer those that offer the largest profit; that is to say,
those which will bear the greatest value when they arrive at
the place of destination. For example, a French merchant has
consigned brandies to England, knd has to receive from En-
gland for such his consignment, £1000 sterling= he naturally
sits down to calculate the difference between what he will
receive, if he import his £1000 in the shape of the precious
metals, and what he will receive, if he irpport that sum in the
shape of cotton manufactures. 151

<!-- I must here take leave to anticipate a position, established in Chapter 21, wherein the subject of money is con-
sidered, namely, that  -->

The total business of national exchange and circulation, requires a given quantity of the commodity, money, of some amount or other. 

There is in France a daily sale of so much wheat, cattle, fuel, property movable and
immovable, which sale requires the daily intervention of a given value in the form of money, because every commodity
is first converted into money, as a step towards its further conversion into other objects of desire. Now, whatever be the
relative abundance or scarcity of the article money, since a given quantum is requisite for the business of circulation, the
money must of course advance in value, as it declines in quan-
tity, and decline in value as it advances in quantity. 

Suppose the money of France to amount now to 3000 millions of
francs, 152 and that by some event, no matter what, it be re-
duced to 1500 millions; the.1500 millions will be quite as
valuable as the 3000 millions. The demands of circulation
require the agency of an actual value of 3000 millions; that is
to say, a value equivalent to 2000 millions of pounds of sugar,
(taking sugar at 30 sous per lb.) or to 180 millions of hectolitres
of wheat (taking wheat at 20 fr. the hectolitre). Whatever be
the weight or bulk of the material, whereof it is made, the
total value of the national money will still remain at that point;
though in the latter case, that material will be twice as valu-
If the merchant find it more advantageous to get his returns in
goods than in specie, and if it be admitted, that he knows his
own interest better than anybody else, the sole point left for
discussion is, whether returns in specie, though less advanta-
geous to the merchant, may not be better for the nation, than
returns of any other article= whether, in short, it be desirable
in a national point of view, that the precious metals should
abound, in preference to any other commodity.

What are the functions of the precious metals in the community? 

If shaped into trinkets or plate, they serve for personal ornament, for the splendour of our domestic establishments,
or for a variety of domestic purposes; they are converted into

able as in the former. An ounce of silver will buy 8 instead of 4 lbs. of sugar, and so of all other commodities;
and the 1500 millions of coin will be equivalent to the former 3000. 

But the nation will be neither richer nor poorer than before. A man who goes to market with a less quantity of
coin, will be able to buy with it the same quantity of commodities. 

A nation that has chosen gold for the material of its money, is equally rich with one that has made choice of sil-
ver, though the volume of its money be much less. 

Should silver become fifteen times as scarce as at present, that is to
say, as scarce as gold now is, an ounce of silver would per-
form the same functions, in the character of money, as an
ounce of gold now does; and we should be equally rich in
money. 

Or, should it fall to a par with copper, we should not be a lot the richer in the article of money; we should merely
be encumbered with a more bulky medium of circulation. But this superiority of money, in the interchange between in-
dividuals, does not extend to that between nation and nation.


In the latter, money, and, a fortiori, bullion, lose all the advantage of their peculiar character, as money, and are dealt
with as mere commodities. The merchant, who has remittances
to make from abroad, looks at nothing but the gain to be made
on those remittances, and treats the precious metals as a com-
modity he can dispose of with more or less benefit. In his
eyes, an exchange more or less is no object; for it is his busi-
ness to negotiate exchanges, so as to get a profit upon them.
An ordinary person might prefer to receive money instead of
goods, because it is an article, whose value he is better ac-
quainted with= but a merchant, who is apprised of the prices
current in most of the markets of the world, knows how to
appreciate the value he receives in return, whatever shape it
may appear under.

On the score, then, of the other utilities of the precious metals, and on that score only, their abundance makes a nation
richer, because it extends the sphere of those utilities, and diffuses their use. In the character of money, that abundance
no wise contributes to national enrichment; 153 but the habits of the vulgar lead them to pronounce an individual rich, in
proportion to the quantity of money he is possessed of; and this notion has been extended to national wealth, which is
made up of the aggregate of individuals’ wealth. 

Wealth, however, as before observed, consists, not in the matter or substance, but in the value of that matter or substance. A money
of large, is worth no more than a money of small volume; 

neither is a money of small, of less value than one of large
volume. Value, in the form of commodities, is equivalent to value to the same amount in the form of money. An individual may be under the necessity of liquidating, for the purpose of giving a new direction to his capital, or of
partition, or the like. 

A nation is never obliged to do so. 

This liquidation is effected with the circulating money of the nation, which it occupies only for the time; the same money
going almost immediately to operate another act of liquidation or of exchange.

We have seen above (Chap. XV) that the abundance of specie is not even necessary for the national facilitation of exchanges
and sales; for that buyers really buy with products, — each with his respective portion of the products he has concurred
in creating= that with this he buys money, which serves but to buy some further product; and that, in this operation, money
affords but a temporary convenience; like the vehicles employed to convey to market the produce of a farm, and to
bring back the articles that have been purchased with the produce. 

Whatever amount of money may have been employed in the purchase of liquidation, it has passed for as much as it
was taken for= and, at the close of the transaction, the indi-
vidual is neither richer nor poorer. The loss or profit arises
out of the nature of the transaction itself, and has no refer-
ence to the medium employed in the course of it.

Why is money so generally preferred to commodities, when the value on both sides is equal? 

This requires a little explanation. 

When I come to treat of money, it will be shown, that the coined metal of equal value commands a preference, because it insures to the holder the attainment of the objects of desire by means of one exchange instead of two. He is not, like the holder of any other com-
modity, obliged, in the first instance, to exchange his own commodity, money, for the purpose of obtaining, by a second
exchange, the object of his desire; one act of exchange suffices. 

This it is, combined with the extreme facility of apportionment, afforded by graduated denominations of the
coin, which renders it so useful in exchanges of value. 

Every individual, who has an exchange to make, becomes a consumer of the commodity, money; that is to say, every individual in the community; which accounts for the universal preference of money to commodities at large, where the value is equal.

In no one way do the causes, that influence individual preference of money to commodities, operate upon international
commerce. When the nation has a smaller stock than its necessities require, its value within the nation is raised, and for-
eign and native merchants are equally interested in the importation of more= when it is redundant, its relative value to
commodities at large is reduced, and it becomes advantageous to export to that spot, where its command of commodities
may be greater than at home. To retain it by compulsory measures, is to force individuals to keep what is a burthen to
them. 154

are now speaking of is not occasioned by the export, but by the consumption, which might have taken place without any
export whatever. I may, therefore, say, with the strictest truth,
that the export of the specie has caused no loss at all to the
nation.

The ignorance called the balance of trade prevails even among the upper classes, writers and statesmen of the
purest intentions and well informed on other points. 

We should guard against some fallacies which are often set up in opposition to liberal principles, and are unfortunately the groundwork of the prevailing policy of most of the European States. 

I shall uniformly reduce the objections to the simplest terms possible,
that their weight may be the more easily estimated.
It has been urged, with much confidence, that, had the export
of 20,000 dollars never been made, France would remain in
possession of that additional value; in fact, that the nation has
lost the amount twice over; first, by the act of export; sec-
ondly, by that of consumption= whereas, the consumption of
an indigenous product would have entailed a single loss only.
But I answer as before, that the export of specie has occa-
sioned no loss; that it was balanced by equivalent value im-
ported; and that it is so certain, that nothing has been lost
except the 20,000 dollars worth of imported commodities,
that I defy any one to point out any other losers than the con-
sumers of those commodities. If there has been no loser, it is
clear there can have been no loss.

They say that by increasing the currency through the means of a favourable balance of trade, the total capital of a nation
is augmented, and, on the contrary, by diminishing it, that capital is reduced. Bul it must be always kept in mind, that
capital consists, not of so much silver or gold, but of the values devoted to reproductive consumption, which values nec-
essarily assume an infinite variety of successive forms. 

When it is intended to vest a given capital in any concern, or to
place it out at interest, the first step is undoubtedly to realize
the amount, by converting 155 into ready money the different
values one has at command. The value of the capital, thus
assuming the transient form of money, is quickly transmuted
by one exchange after another into buildings, works, and per-
ishable substances requisite for the projected enterprise. The
ready money employed for the occasion passes again into
other hands, for the purpose of facilitating fresh exchanges,
as soon as it has accomplished its momentary duty; in like
manner as do many other substances, the shape of which this
capital successively assumes. So that the value of capital is
neither lost nor impaired by parting with its value, whatever
material shape it happens to be under, provided that we part
with it in a way that ensures its renovation.

Would you put a stop to the emigration of capital? 

It is not to be prevented by keeping the specie in the country. A man
resolved to transfer his capital elsewhere can do it just as
effectually by the consignment of goods, whose export is per-
mitted. 156 

So much the better, we may be told; for our manufacturers will benefit by the exports. True; but their value
exists no longer in the nation, since they bring back no return
wherewith to make new purchases; there has been a transfer
of so much capital from a/mongst you, to give activity not to
your own, but to some other nation’s industry. 

This is a real ground of apprehension. Capital naturally flows to those places
that hold out security and lucrative employment, and gradu-
ally retires from countries offering no such advantages= but it
may easily enough retire, without being ever converted into
specie.

Suppose a French dealer in foreign commodities to consign to a foreign country a capital of 10,000 dollars in specie for
the purchase of cotton; when his cotton arrives, he possesses
20,000 dollars value in cotton instead of specie, putting his
profit out of the question for the moment. 

Has anybody lost this amount of specie? Certainly not= the adventurer has come
honestly by it. 

A cotton manufacturer gives cash for the cargo;

is he the loser of the price? No, surely= on the contrary, the article in his hands will increase to twice its value, so as to
leave him a profit, after repaying all his advances. 

If no individual capitalist has lost the 20,000 dollars exported, how can the nation have lost them? The loss will fall on the con-
sumer, they will tell you= in fact, all the cotton goods bought and consumed will be so much positive loss; but the same
consumers might have consumed linens or woollens of exactly the same value, without one dollar of the 20,000 being
sent out of the country, and yet there would equally be a loss
or consumption to that amount of value. 

The loss of value we

If the export of specie causes no diminution of national capital, provided it be followed by a corresponding return, on the
other hand, its import brings no accession of capital. 

For, in reality, before specie can be imported, it must have been pur-
chased by an equivalent value exported for that purpose.

On this point it has been alleged, that by sending abroad goods instead of specie, a demand is created for goods, and the pro-
ducers enabled to make a profit upon their production. I answer, that, even when specie is sent abroad, that specie must
have been first obtained by the export of some indigenous product; for, we may rest assured, that the foreign owner of it
did not give it to the French importer for nothing; and France
had nothing to offer in the first instance but her domestic
products. If the supply of the precious metals in the country
be more than sufficient for the wants of the country, it is a
fitter object of export than another commodity; and, if more

pose national wealth; they are useful to the community no
longer than while they do not exceed the national demand for
them. Any such excess must make the sellers more numerous
than the buyers; consequently must depress the price in pro-
portion, and thus create a powerful inducement to buy in the
home market, in the expectation of making a profit upon the
export. This may be illustrated by an example.

of the specie be exported than the excess of the supply above the demand for the purposes of circulation, we may calculate
with certainty, that, since the value of specie must have been necessarily raised by the exportation, other specie will be
imported to replace what has been withdrawn; for the purchase of which last, home products must have been sent
abroad, which will have yielded a profit to the home producers. 

In a word, every value sent out of France, for the purchase of foreign returns for the French market, may be re-
solved into a product of domestic industry, given either first
or last, for France has nothing else to procure them with.

Suppose for a moment the internal traffic and national wealth of a given country to be such as to require the constant em-
ploy of a thousand carriages of different kinds. 

Suppose, too, that, by some peculiar system of commerce, we should suc-
ceed in getting more carriages annually imported, than were
annually destroyed by wear and tear; so that, at the year’s
end, there should be 1500 instead of 1000; is it not obvious,
that there would be in that case 500 lying by in the reposito-
ries quite useless, and that the owners of them, rather than
suffer their value to lie dormant, would undersell each other,
and even smuggle them abroad if it were practicable, in the
hope of turning them to better account? In vain would the
government conclude commercial treaties for the encourage-
ment of their import= in vain would it expend its efforts in
stimulating the export of other commodities, for the purpose
of getting returns in the shape of carriages; the more the pub-
lic authorities favoured the import, the more anxious would
individuals be to export.

They argued that it is better to export consumable articles, as, for instance, manufactures, and to keep at
home those products not liable to consumption, or, at least,
not to quick consumption, such as specie. 

Yet objects of quick consumption, if more in demand, are more profitable to keep
than objects of slower consumption. It would often be doing
a producer a very poor service, to make him substitute a quan-
tity of commodities of slow consumption, for an equal por-
tion of his capital of more rapid consumption. If an ironmaster
were to contract for the delivery to him of a quantity of coal
at a day certain, and when the day came the coal could not be
procurable, and he should be offered the value in money in
its stead, it would be somewhat difficult to convince him of
the service done him by the delivery of money; which is an
object of much slower consumption than the coal he con-
tracted for. Should a dyer send an order for dying woods from
abroad, it would be a positive injury to send him gold, on the
plea, that, with equal value, it has the advantage of greater
durability. He had no occasion for a durable article whatever;
what he wanted was a substance, which, though decomposed
in his vats, would quickly re-appear in the colours of his
stuffs. 157

As it is with carriages, so is it with specie likewise. The demand is limited; it can form but a part of the aggregate wealth
of the nation. That wealth can not possibly consist entirely of
specie; for other things are requisite besides specie. 

The extent of the demand for that peculiar article is proportionate to the general wealth; in the same manner, as a greater number
of carriages is wanted in a rich than in a poor country. 

Whatever brilliant or solid qualities the precious metals may possess, their value depends upon the use made of them, and that
use is limited. Like carriages, they have a value peculiar to them; a value that diminishes in proportion to the increase of
their relative plenty, in comparison with the objects of exchange, and increases in proportion to their relative scarcity.
If it were no advantage to import any but the most durable items of productive capital, there are other very durable ob-
jects, such as stone or iron, that ought to share in our partial-
ity with silver and gold. 

But the point of real importance is, the durability, not of any particular substance, but of the value
of capital. Now the value of capital is perpetuated, notwith-
standing the repeated change of the material shape in which
it is vested. Nay, it cannot yield either interest or profit, un-
less that shape be continually varied. 

To confine it to the single shape of money. would be to condemn it to remain unproductive.

One is told, that every thing may be procured with gold or
silver. True; but upon what terms? The terms are less advan-
tageous, when these metals are forcibly multiplied beyond
the demand; hence their strong tendency to emigration under
such circumstances. 

The export of silver from Spain was prohibited; yet Spain supplied all Europe with it. In 1812, the
paper money of England having rendered superfluous all the
gold money of that country, and made that metal too abun-
dant for its other remaining uses, its relative value fell, and
her guineas emigrated to France, in spite of the ease with
which the coasts of an island may be guarded, and of the
denunciation of capital punishment against the exporters.

But I will go a step further, and, having shown that there is no advantage in importing gold and silver more than any other
article of merchandise, I will assert, that, supposing it were desirable to have the balance of trade always in our favour,
yet it is morally impossible it should be so. Gold and silverare like all the other substances that, in the aggregate, com-


To what good purpose, then, do governments labour to turn the balance of commerce in favour of their respective na-
tions? To none whatever; unless, perhaps, to exhibit the show
of financial advantages, unsupported by fact or experience. 158
How can maxims so clear, so agreeable to plain common
sense, and to facts attested by all who have made commerce
their study, have yet been rejected in practice by all the ruling
powers of Europe, 159 nay, even have been attacked by a num-
ber of writers, that have evinced both genius and information
on other subjects? 

To speak the truth, it is because the first principles of political economy are as yet but little known;
because ingenious systems and reasonings have been built
upon hollow foundations, and taken advantage of, on the one
hand, by interested rulers, who employ prohibition as a
weapon of offence or an instrument of revenue; and, on the
other, by the personal avarice of merchants and manufacturers, who have a private interest in exclusive measures, and
take but little pains to inquire, whether their profits arise from
actual production, or from a simultaneous loss thrown upon other classes of the community.

By the absolute exclusion of specific manufactures of foreign fabric, a government establishes a monopoly in favour
of the home producers of these articles, and in prejudice of the home consumers; that is to say, those classes of the nation
which produce them, being entitled to their exclusive sale, can raise their prices above the natural rate; while the home
consumers, being unable to purchase elsewhere, are compelled to pay for them unnaturally dear. 161 If the articles be not wholly
prohibited, but merely saddled with an import duty, the home producer can then increase their price by the whole amount
of the duty, and the consumer will have to pay the difference.

For example, if an import duty of 20 cents per dozen be laid upon earthenware plates worth 60 cents per dozen, the im-
porter whatever country he may belong to, must charge the consumer 30 cents; and the home manufacturer of that com-
modity is enabled to ask 80 cents per dozen of his customersfor plates of the same quality; which he could not do without the intervention of the duty because the consumer could get the same article for 60 cents= thus, a premium to the whole extent of the duty is given to the home manufacturer out of the consumer’s pocket.
