10 per cent of the FOB value of that good. The value of
those non-originating materials shall be determined
pursuant to paragraph 3 of Article 3.5 (Calculation of
Regional Value Content); or
(b) for a good classified in Chapters 50 through 63 of the HS
Code, the weight of all non-originating materials used in its
production that did not undergo the required change in tariff

set out in Annex 3A (Product-Specific Rules), provided that:
(a) the accessories, spare parts, tools, and instructional or
other information materials presented with the good are not
invoiced separately from the good; and
(b) the quantities and value of the accessories, spare parts,
tools, and instructional or other information materials
presented with the good are customary for the good.

materials or non-originating materials, as the case may be, in
calculating the regional value content of the good, provided that:
(a)
the accessories, spare parts, tools, and instructional or
other information materials presented with the good are not
invoiced separately from the good; and
3-9(b)
the quantities and value of the accessories, spare parts,
tools, and instructional or other information materials
presented with the good are customary for the good.

Article 3.11: Fungible Goods or Materials
The determination of whether fungible goods or materials are originating
shall be made either by physical segregation of each of the fungible
3-10goods or materials or, where commingled, by the use of an inventory
management method which is recognised in the Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles of the exporting Party, and should be used
throughout the fiscal year.
Article 3.12: Materials Used in Production
If a non-originating material undergoes further production such that it
satisfies the requirements of this Chapter, the material shall be treated
as originating when determining the originating status of the
subsequently produced good, regardless of whether that material was
produced by the producer of the good.
Article 3.13: Unit of Qualification
1. The unit of qualification for the application of this Chapter shall be
the particular good which is considered as the basic unit when
determining classification under the Harmonized System.
