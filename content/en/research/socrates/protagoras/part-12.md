{{< r a="Hippias-the-Sage" >}}
I think, Socrates, that you have given a very good explanation of the poem. But I also have an excellent interpretation of my own if you would let me share it.
{{< /r >}}


{{< r a="Alcibiades" >}}
No, Hippias, not now. Maybe some other time.

At present, we must abide by the compact which was made between Socrates and Protagoras. 

As long as Protagoras is willing to ask, Socrates should answer; or that if he would rather answer, then that Socrates should ask.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
I wish Protagoras either to ask or answer as he is inclined. 

But I would rather have done with poems and odes, if he does not object, and come back to the question about which I was asking you at first, Protagoras, and by your help make an end of that.

The talk about the poets seems to me like a commonplace entertainment to which a vulgar company have recourse. 

They are not able to converse or amuse one another while they are drinking because of their stupidity. And so they raise the price of flute-girls in the market. 

They hire for a great sum the voice of a flute instead of their own breath, to be the medium of intercourse among them.

But where the company are real gentlemen and men of education, you will see no flute-girls, nor dancing-girls, nor harp-girls..

They have no nonsense or games, but are contented with one another's conversation, of which their own voices are the medium, and which they carry on by turns and in an orderly manner, even though they are very liberal in their potations.

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
A company like this of ours, and men such as we profess to be, do not require the help of another's voice, or of the poets whom you cannot interrogate about the meaning of what they are saying; people who cite them declaring, some that the poet has one meaning, and others that he has another, and the point which is in dispute can never be decided.

This sort of entertainment they decline, and prefer to talk with one another, and put one another to the proof in conversation. And these are the models which I desire that you and I should imitate. Leaving the poets, and keeping to ourselves, let us try the mettle of one another and make proof of the truth in conversation. If you have a mind to ask, I am ready to answer; or if you would rather, do you answer, and give me the opportunity of resuming and completing our unfinished argument.
{{< /l >}}


Protagoras would not distinctly say which he would do. Thereupon Alcibiades turned to Callias.


{{< r a="Alcibiades" >}}
Do you think, Callias, that Protagoras is fair in refusing to say whether he will or will not answer? 

I think that he is unfair. He should either proceed with the argument, or distinctly refuse to proceed, that we may know his intention; and then Socrates will be able to discourse with some one else, and the rest of the company will be free to talk with one another.
{{< /r >}}


Protagoras was really made ashamed by these words of Alcibiades, and when the prayers of Callias and the company were superadded, he was at last induced to argue, and said that I might ask and he would answer.


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Do not imagine, Protagoras, that I have any other interest in asking questions of you but that of clearing up my own difficulties. For I think that Homer was very right in saying that

     'When two go together, one sees before the other (Il.),'
for all men who have a companion are readier in deed, word, or thought; but if a man

     'Sees a thing when he is alone,'
he goes about straightway seeking until he finds some one to whom he may show his discoveries, and who may confirm him in them. 

I would rather hold discourse with you than with any one, because I think that no man has a better understanding of most things which a good man may be expected to understand, and in particular of virtue. 

For who is there, but you?—who not only claim to be a good man and a gentleman, for many are this, and yet have not the power of making others good—whereas you are not only good yourself, but also the cause of goodness in others.
{{< /l >}}

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Moreover such confidence have you in yourself, that although other Sophists conceal their profession, you proclaim in the face of Hellas that you are a Sophist or teacher of virtue and education, and are the first who demanded pay in return.

How then can I do otherwise than invite you to the examination of these subjects, and ask questions and consult with you? I must, indeed.

I should like once more to have my memory refreshed by you about the questions which I was asking you at first, and also to have your help in considering them. If I am not mistaken the question was this: 

Are wisdom and temperance and courage and justice and holiness five names of the same thing? 

or has each of the names a separate underlying essence and corresponding thing having a peculiar function, no one of them being like any other of them? 

You replied that the five names were not the names of the same thing, but that each of them had a separate object, and that all these objects were parts of virtue, not in the same way that the parts of gold are like each other and the whole of which they are parts, but as the parts of the face are unlike the whole of which they are parts and one another, and have each of them a distinct function. 

I should like to know whether this is still your opinion; or if not, I will ask you to define your meaning, and I shall not take you to task if you now make a different statement. For I dare say that you may have said what you did only in order to make trial of me.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Protagoras" >}}
All these qualities are parts of virtue. Four out of the five are to some extent similar. The fifth is courage. It is very different from the other four.

Many men are utterly unrighteous, unholy, intemperate, ignorant, who are nevertheless remarkable for their courage.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Stop, I would like to think about that. 

When you speak of brave men, do you mean the confident, or another sort of nature?
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Protagoras" >}}
Yes, I mean the impetuous, ready to go at that which others are afraid to approach.
{{< /r >}}

In the next place, you would affirm virtue to be a good thing, of which good thing you assert yourself to be a teacher.

{{< r a="Protagoras" >}}
Yes, I should say the best of all things, if I am in my right mind.
{{< /r >}}


Is it partly good and partly bad, I said, or wholly good?


{{< r a="Protagoras" >}}
Wholly good, and in the highest degree.
{{< /r >}}

Who are they who have confidence when diving into a well?

I should say, the divers.

And the reason of this is that they have knowledge?

Yes, that is the reason.

And who have confidence when fighting on horseback—the skilled horseman or the unskilled?

The skilled.

And who when fighting with light shields—the peltasts or the nonpeltasts?

The peltasts. And that is true of all other things, he said, if that is your point: those who have knowledge are more confident than those who have no knowledge, and they are more confident after they have learned than before.

And have you not seen persons utterly ignorant, I said, of these things, and yet confident about them?

Yes, he said, I have seen such persons far too confident.

And are not these confident persons also courageous?

In that case, he replied, courage would be a base thing, for the men of whom we are speaking are surely madmen.

Then who are the courageous? Are they not the confident?

Yes, he said; to that statement I adhere.

And those, I said, who are thus confident without knowledge are really not courageous, but mad; and in that case the wisest are also the most confident, and being the most confident are also the bravest, and upon that view again wisdom will be courage.


{{< r a="Protagoras" >}}
Nay, Socrates. You are mistaken in your remembrance of what was said by me.
{{< /r >}}

When you asked me, I certainly did say that the courageous are the confident; but I was never asked whether the confident are the courageous; if you had asked me, I should have answered 'Not all of them': and what I did answer you have not proved to be false, although you proceeded to show that those who have knowledge are more courageous than they were before they had knowledge, and more courageous than others who have no knowledge, and were then led on to think that courage is the same as wisdom. 

But in this way of arguing you might come to imagine that strength is wisdom. You might begin by asking whether the strong are able, and I should say 'Yes'; and then whether those who know how to wrestle are not more able to wrestle than those who do not know how to wrestle, and more able after than before they had learned, and I should assent. 

When I had admitted this, you might use my admissions in such a way as to prove that upon my view wisdom is strength; whereas in that case I should not have admitted, any more than in the other, that the able are strong, although I have admitted that the strong are able. 

For there is a difference between ability and strength; the former is given by knowledge as well as by madness or rage, but strength comes from nature and a healthy state of the body. And in like manner I say of confidence and courage, that they are not the same. 

I argue that the courageous are confident, but not all the confident courageous. For confidence may be given to men by art, and also, like ability, by madness and rage; but courage comes to them from nature and the healthy state of the soul.

I said: You would admit, Protagoras, that some men live well and others ill?

He assented.

And do you think that a man lives well who lives in pain and grief?

He does not.

But if he lives pleasantly to the end of his life, will he not in that case have lived well?

He will.

Then to live pleasantly is a good, and to live unpleasantly an evil?

{{< r a="Protagoras" >}}
Yes, if the pleasure be good and honourable.
{{< /r >}}

And do you, Protagoras, like the rest of the world, call some pleasant things evil and some painful things good?—for I am rather disposed to say that things are good in as far as they are pleasant, if they have no consequences of another sort, and in as far as they are painful they are bad.

{{< r a="Protagoras" >}}
I do not know whether I can venture to assert in that unqualified manner that the pleasant is the good and the painful the evil. Having regard not only to my present answer, but also to the whole of my life, I shall be safer, if I am not mistaken, in saying that there are some pleasant things which are not good, and that there are some painful things which are good, and some which are not good, and that there are some which are neither good nor evil.
{{< /r >}}

And you would call pleasant, I said, the things which participate in pleasure or create pleasure?

Certainly, he said.

Then my meaning is, that in as far as they are pleasant they are good; and my question would imply that pleasure is a good in itself.

{{< r a="Protagoras" >}}
According to your favourite mode of speech, Socrates, 'Let us reflect about this'. If the reflection is to the point, and the result proves that pleasure and good are really the same, then we will agree; but if not, then we will argue.
{{< /r >}}


And would you wish to begin the enquiry? I said; or shall I begin?

{{< r a="Protagoras" >}}
You should take the lead as you are the author of the discussion.
{{< /r >}}


May I employ an illustration? I said. Suppose some one who is enquiring into the health or some other bodily quality of another:—he looks at his face and at the tips of his fingers, and then he says, Uncover your chest and back to me that I may have a better view:—that is the sort of thing which I desire in this speculation. Having seen what your opinion is about good and pleasure, I am minded to say to you: Uncover your mind to me, Protagoras, and reveal your opinion about knowledge, that I may know whether you agree with the rest of the world. Now the rest of the world are of opinion that knowledge is a principle not of strength, or of rule, or of command: their notion is that a man may have knowledge, and yet that the knowledge which is in him may be overmastered by anger, or pleasure, or pain, or love, or perhaps by fear,—just as if knowledge were a slave, and might be dragged about anyhow. Now is that your view? or do you think that knowledge is a noble and commanding thing, which cannot be overcome, and will not allow a man, if he only knows the difference of good and evil, to do anything which is contrary to knowledge, but that wisdom will have strength to help him?

{{< r a="Protagoras" >}}
I agree with you. I, above all other men, am bound to say that wisdom and knowledge are the highest of human things.
{{< /r >}}


Good, I said, and true. But are you aware that the majority of the world are of another mind; and that men are commonly supposed to know the things which are best, and not to do them when they might? And most persons whom I have asked the reason of this have said that when men act contrary to knowledge they are overcome by pain, or pleasure, or some of those affections which I was just now mentioning.

{{< r a="Protagoras" >}}
Yes, Socrates. That is not the only point about which mankind are in error.
{{< /r >}}


Suppose, then, that you and I endeavour to instruct and inform them what is the nature of this affection which they call 'being overcome by pleasure,' and which they affirm to be the reason why they do not always do what is best. When we say to them: Friends, you are mistaken, and are saying what is not true, they would probably reply: Socrates and Protagoras, if this affection of the soul is not to be called 'being overcome by pleasure,' pray, what is it, and by what name would you describe it?

{{< r a="Protagoras" >}}
But why should we trouble ourselves about the opinion of the many, who just say anything that happens to occur to them?
{{< /r >}}

I believe that they may be of use in helping us to discover how courage is related to the other parts of virtue. If you are disposed to abide by our agreement, that I should show the way in which, as I think, our recent difficulty is most likely to be cleared up, do you follow; but if not, never mind.

{{< r a="Protagoras" >}}
You are quite right. I would have you proceed as you have begun.
