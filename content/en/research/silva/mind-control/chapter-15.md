CHAPTER FIFTEEN
SOME SPECULATIONS
Chapters 3 to 15, which you have just read, were de-
signed, like the Mind Control course, to help you use
more of your mind in special ways to solve the kinds
of problems that beset every human life. What you
have read stems from my more than thirty years of
study and experiment As you can see, I have kept my
work on a very practical level, perhaps because I was
born very poor and life presented me with practical
problems from the beginning.
Along the way, however, it seemed only natural to
speculate on the many discoveries that amazed me. Be-
cause I have been influenced by a great deal of reading,
by learned associates, and perhaps most of all by the
very rich tradition of Christianity, I can claim little
originality for these thoughts.
One of the things that amazed me was that nothing
I discovered to be truly workable conflicted in any way
with my religious convictions. For tragic centuries there
nas been an uncomfortable relationship between science
and religion. I have never experienced this personally.
What amazed me even more is that my findings did not
conflict with any other religion or, in fact, with any
established world view. Among our enthusiastic grad-
uates are atheists, Protestants of every denomination,
115116 
Catholics, Jews, Moslems, Buddhists, and Hindus,
along with scientists and scholars of a wide spectrum
of disciplines.
Does this mean that there are no values inherent in
Mind Control? Are the techniques I developed neither
good nor bad, like the multiplication table? I said I
would deal with speculations in this chapter, but on this
point I have some firm convictions, which I believe I
can support with logic. Let me express these in a kind
of catechism:
1. Does the universe have laws? Of course—science
is discovering them.
2. Can we break these laws? No. We can jump from
a building and die, or make ourselves sick, but the laws
are not broken; we are.
3. Can the universe think about itself? We know that
at least one part of it can: we ourselves. Is it not rea-
sonable to conclude that the whole can?
4. Is the universe indifferent to us? How could it be?
We are part of it, and it responds to us.
5. Are we fundamentally good or bad? When we are
in closest touch with ourselves—in meditation—we are
capable of no harm at all and a vast amount of good.
Were it not for my experiments which prove out
number 5, I and my view of reality would be vastly
different.
The best definition I ever heard of reality is that it is
the one dream we all share. We have only the faintest
hints of what it actually is. What we perceive, the way
we see things, is largely for our own convenience.
Things at a distance are not really smaller, and solid
things are not really solid.

picture, is frequency, or what energy is doing and how
fast Matter is energy, too, as we learn from E = M C
—it is energy doing something else, being in another
state. An interesting thing about energy—in a world of
opposites: up and down, black and white, fast and
slow—is that there is no opposite for energy. This is
because there is nothing that is not energy, including
you and me and everything we think. Thinking both
consumes and creates energy, or, to be more accurate,
it converts energy.
a
You can see now why I find little separation between
a thought and a thing.
Can thoughts influence things? Of course; energy
can.
Can thoughts influence events? Of course; energy
can.
Is time energy? I have only the most tentative specula-
tions on this because time presents so many different
faces to us. Look at it one way and we think we see
it clearly, then look at it another way and it seems al-
together different
To tie our shoelaces or cross a street we had better
think of time as running in a straight line from past
through the present into the future. We must think of it
this way in order to get through the everyday job of
living, just as we still conveniently think of the sun as
rising and setting, as if the old astronomy of Coper-
nicus had never been proved wrong. From this per-
spective we can remember the past experience the pres-
ent, and look uncertainly, if at all, into the future.
Not so from another perspective. In Alpha and
Theta we can look into the future as well as the past
Coming events do cast their shadows before, and we can
be trained to see them. This ability is known by the
now-respectable word "precognition." It was far less
respectable when I won the Mexican lottery.118 
If in Alpha and Theta the future can be seen here and
now, it must send ahead some kind of energy, which we
can tune in to. For time to send any kind of energy
anywhere, it must be an energy itself.
I discovered something rather strange about how we
perceive time many years ago when I was experiment-
ing with hypnosis. When I put two of my children
through age regression—taking them back in time—
if the change of scenery from present to past started too
abruptly, they would lurch to their right just as when
we are moving forward on a bus and it stops abruptly,
we lurch forward.
The children felt that in traveling backward in time
they were traveling to their right When I returned them
to the present and stopped, the reverse would happen;
they would lurch to the left Many of my early experi-
ments with different subjects confirmed this.
Later, when I abandoned hypnosis for controlled
meditation, I wanted to learn how, subjectively, to move
backward and forward in time. I faced east because
Oriental disciplines specify facing in that direction and
east seemed as good a direction as any. Then I won-
dered if I would be able to move around more freely
in time if, taking a cue from the hypnosis experiments,
I put the future on my left and the past on my right
On this planet the sun brings the new day from the
east and carries it to the west If I faced south during
meditation, east would be on my left and west on my
right and I would thus be oriented to the planetary
flow of time.
Whether or not I really discovered the direction in
which time flows on earth, I do not know; I do know
that once I began facing south I felt better oriented in
time and could move around in it more easily.

Some Speculations / 119
Now let us deal with a larger question. I have men-
tioned Higher Intelligence a number of times in past
chapters. Is this some noncommittal way of mine of
referring to God? I cannot prove what I am about to
say; I must speak from faith. My answer is no, by
Higher Intelligence I do not mean God. I use capitals
for the words because I am so respectful of it but to
me it is not God.
The universe seems to do what it does with remark-
able efficiency—without a scrap of waste. When I put
one foot in front of another, I cannot believe it is one
of God's preoccupations to see that I do not trip, nor,
for that matter, is it a concern of Higher Intelligence; it
is mine. I was genetically programmed to learn to walk;
that was God's work. Now that I have learned, the
routine steps are up to me.
However, some steps in life are not routine, and I
may need information not available through the five
senses to make a decision. For this I turn to Higher In-
telligence. Sometimes I need overall advice of tran-
scending importance. For this I turn to God. I pray.
I see various levels of intelligence as a continuum,
going from inanimate matter to the vegetable to the
animal, then to the human and to Higher Intelligence
and finally to God. I believe I have scientifically found
ways of communicating with each level, from the in-
animate to Higher Intelligence. I have conducted ex-
periments under controlled conditions and proved them
out through repetition, and anyone who follows the in-
structions in this book or takes the course in Mind
Control can reproduce them. This is what I mean by
"scientific." Much of the rest is speculation and faith;
not this.
Just one more of my speculations: In the perspective
of our long history, we humans have just recently com-
pleted an evolutionary stage. This was the development120 
of our brain. This is now over with and done; we have
all the brain cells we are going to get. The next stage
is already in progress: the development of our mind.
Soon what are now considered special psychic abilities
will be commonplace for all of us, as they are today
among Mind Control graduates and those readers who
follow the steps I have outlined in this book.
You can see from these speculations that I have a
certain view of the world and of what constitutes truth
and reality. Now it is fair for you to ask, "Do Mind
Control graduates emerge from their experiences with
views similar to these?" No, far from it Let me give
you an example.
Among those who remain closest to Mind Control
practices, an amazing number become vegetarians.
Harry McKnight, who works closest with me, did this
recently. I enjoy a good steak.
