The previous post explained the Law of Conservation of Idea which is the cause of all movement and change in the universe. 

All of this movement is relative to other ideas, which manifest as entities in the physical domain. This leads to our Theory of Universal Relativity. 

Here we explain 'The Elastic Theory' or the Theory of Elastic Gravitational Bands which is a consolidation of the theories from:

- Socrates, as the relativity of the motions in the heavens
- Kepler, as the links of kinship between planetary bodies
- Descartes, as the aether powering all movement
