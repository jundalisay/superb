## Classification via Supervised

Logistic Regression: Splits things binarily 
SVM 
Random Forest
Naive Bayes

## Collaborating Filtering: Fills in the missing entries in a table based on common attributes

Alternating Least Squares

## Regression 

Linear Regression 

## Clustering: Grouping by parameter

K-Means
LDA

## Dimensionality Reduction: removing noise

Principal Component analysis - uses a pricipal component as the basis and ignores the other components as noiie
