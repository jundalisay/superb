In a previous post, we pinpointed the guaranteed collapse of the Philippines to the neoliberal policies of the corrupt Diosdado Macapagal in the early 1960's. He devalued the peso on January 22, 1962 for the sake of easy economic growth. This made borrowing attractive since the currency could be devalued to make debt payments easier at the cost of inflation.

This is what Marcos did to perfection. 

If the Philippines of the 1970s were a family with Marcos the father, then he was a father who became so dazzled by foreign money that he sold his house and his children as slaves just to get that money. The house is now occupied by a foreign oligarchy who hold dual US-Philippines citizenships, while those slaves are now called Overseas Filipino Workers or OFWs. Hordes of OFWs now must work overseas to bring that money into the banks and economy of the foreign oligarchs who are the new masters of the house.

The corrupt neoliberalism of Macapagal was continued by his daughter Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo or GMA by:

<!--   The woman who ‘sold Spratlys to China’. This alone is a treason, but she was even effective in avoiding that by preventing the coup of 2006 (In contrast, Cory had so many coups)

<!-- She was able to make her evil policies effective (do as intended), as opposed to the other presidents who made policies that failed to achieve their goals. -->

<!-- Cory Aquino was the worst president in terms of damage to country because she actually legalized the permanent selling of the country. The errors of Diosdado Macapagal and Marcos could be reversed by changes in law. But Cory cemented policy mistakes in the Constitution itself.
Erap was the most incompetent and corrupt president but thankfully didn't do too much damage since he didn’t even finish his term
Noy Aquino was the second most incompetent (Yolanda, SAF44, drugs, MRT)
Ramos was just a less effective than GMA. His MWSS privatization was a failure in the beginning. The MRT was inadequate. BGC was a traffic-maker. -->

In a nutshell, GMA is like an evil corporate executive who does much work, but charges a high fee, which manifests as corruption and the support of oligarchs — the neoliberal way of governance. 

For an enslaved people who have surrendered their sovereignty to the Church, oligarchs, and vested interests, having a mild, but effective slave driver (President) who can provide some real benefits (economic growth) might be the lesser evil to corrupt politicians that cannot deliver anything, such as Erap.
