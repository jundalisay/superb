## 13th CONGRESS Second Regular Session

Introduced by Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago 

The Constitution, Article 11, Section 15, provides: The State  shall protect  and  promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. Three pandemics occurred during the 20th century: 

The Spanish flu pandemic in 1918; the Asian flu pandemic in 1957; and the Hang Kong flu pandemic in 1968. The Spanish flu pandemic was the most severe, causing over 500,000 deaths in the United States and more than 20,000,000 deaths worldwide. Recent studies suggest that avian  influenza  strains, which are endemic in wild birds and poultry  populations in some countries, are becoming increasingly capable of causing  severe disease in humans and are likely to cause the next pandemic flu. In 2004, eight nations -Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Japan, Laos,  China,  Cambodia,  and the  Republic of Korea - experienced outbreaks  of  avian  flu, particularly of the H5N1 strain,  among  poultry flocks.  Cases  of human infections were  confirmed  in  Thailand and Vietnam (including a  possible human-to-human infection in Thailand). 

As of 15 April 2005, 88 confirmed human cases of this specific  avian influenza  have been reported, 5 1 of which resulted in death. 

Of these cases, 68 were in Vietnam, e 17 in Thailand, and three in Cambodia. On 23 February 2005, Dr.  Shigeru Omi, Asia regional  director of the World Health Organization (WHO), stated with respect to the avian flu, “We at WHO believe that the world  is now in the gravest possible danger of a pandemic.” 

The best defense against influenza pandemics is a heightened global  surveillance system. In many of the  nations  where the H5N1 avian flu has become  endemic,  the early  detection capabilities and the transparency in health systems are severely lacking. * In addition to surveillance, pandemic preparedness requires  domestic  and international coordination and cooperation to ensure an adequate medical response, including communication and information  networks,  public health  measures  to  prevent spread,  use of vaccination and antivirals,  provision of health  outpatient  and  inpatient  services, and maintenance of core  public functions.
