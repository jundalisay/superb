<!-- EXPLANATORY NOTE
The Agenda for Prosperity of the Administration of President Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos, Jr.
seeks to fulfill the objectives of its Medium-Term Fiscal Framework and 8-Point Socioeconomic
Agenda, which Congress adopted, in order to see the Philippine economy soar to greater heights
in spite of external shocks.
The Agenda includes achieving single digit poverty levels and upper middle-income status for
Filipinos by hitting 6.5 to 8 percent real gross domestic product (GDP) growth annually between
2023 and 2028. -->

<!-- To achieve these economic goals, it is essential to pursue the Administration's priority
development plans and projects, improve investment opportunities, promote productivity-
enhancing investments, and ensure that the Philippines becomes an investment destination.
With these objectives in mind, this bill seeks to establish the Maharlika Investments Fund (MIF),
a sovereign wealth Fund (SWF) that will provide for the management, investment, and use of the
proceedsofthefund.
Sovereign Wealth Funds are state-owned investment funds typically financed by a country's
surplus revenues or reserves. Governments invest these funds in an array of both real and financial
assets to stabilize national budgets, create savings for their citizens, or promote economic
development.1 -->

The MIF would give Government Financial Institutions (GFIs), including the GSIS, SSS, LBP, DBP, the opportunity to:
- ensure their respective funds' optimal asset allocation 
- ensure that resources are efficiently channeled to investments that will provide the most value to the country.

SWFs can also successfully be used as a tool of national strategy. 

This is evidenced by the successful performance of Singapore's SWFs, such as the GIC private Limited which provide the financial means for Singapore to:
- manage its foreign reserves
- defend itself and protect its sovereigrty without compromising its domestic program
- augment its land-limited economic space with global investments.

SWFs can also be used to attract direct investments, as what the Indonesia Investment Authority (INA) did. 

By attracting foreign co-investors to capitalize the fund rather than rely on commodity revenues, the INA has been very successful in bringing in much-needed investments in infrastructure and emerging industries, ultimately spurring growth in Indonesia

<!-- , such as investments in transportation,includingairports.supplychains,logistics,digitalinfrastructure,the green economy, healthcare services, the financial sector, technology, and tourism. -->

To ensure transparency and accountability, the MIF will adhere to the Santiago Principles, i .e., the Generally Accepted Principles and Practices (GAPP) agreed to in October 2008 in Santiago, Chile. 

This is in a collaborative global effort among countries with SWFs, investment recipient countries and international organizations, to observe: 
- the compliance of the SWF with all regulatory and disclosure requirements in the countries in which SWFs invest
- that the SWF will have in place a transparent and sound governance structure that provides adequate operational controls, risk management, and accountability , among other commitments.

There are now almost 50 countries with a sovereign wealth Fund. 

In Asia alone, the nations that currently have SWFs are:
- Singapore
- China
- Hong Kong
- South Korea
- Malaysia
- Indonesia
- Taiwan
- Vietnam
- East Timor

As the Philippines secures its place not only as the RIsing Star of Asia but as a real economic leader in the Asia Pacific, the creation of the MIF becomes imperative.

In view of the foregoing, the immediate approval of this bill to create the Maharlika Wealth Fund is urgently sought.
