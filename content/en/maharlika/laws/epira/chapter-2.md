## Section 5. Organization

The electric power industry shall be divided into 4 sectors:

- generation
- transmission
- distribution
- supply


## Section 6. Generation

The generation of electric power<!-- , a business affected with public interest, --> shall be competitive and open.

Any new generation company must secure:
- from the ERC a certificate of compliance. 
- health, safety and environmental clearances from the appropriate government agencies under existing laws.

Any law to the contrary notwithstanding, power generation shall not be considered a public utility operation. 

For this purpose, any person or entity engaged or which shall engage in power generation and supply of electricity shall not be required to secure a national franchise.

Upon implementation of retail competition and open access, the prices charged by a generation company for the supply of electricity shall not be subject to regulation by the ERC except as otherwise provided in this Act.

Pursuant to the objective of lowering electricity rates to end-users, sales of generated power by
generation companies shall be value added tax zero-rated.

The ERC shall, in determining the existence of market power abuse or anti-competitive behavior, require from generation companies the submission of their financial statements.


## Section 7 Transmission Sector

The transmission of electric power shall be regulated common electricity carries business, subject to the ratemaking powers of the ERC.

The ERC shall set the standards of the voltage transmission that shall distinguish the transmission from the subtransmission assets. 

Pending the issuance of such new standards, the distinction between the transmission and subtransmission assets shall be as follows:
- 230 kilovolts and above in the Luzon grid
- 69 kilovolts and above in the Visayas and in the isolated distribution systems
- 138 kilovolts and above in the Mindanao Grid

Provided, That for the Visayas and the isolated distribution system, should the 69 kilovolt line not form part of the main transmission grid and be directly connected to the substation of the distribution utility, it shall form part of the subtransmission system.


## Section 8. Creation of the National Transmission Company

TRANSCO is created to assume the electrical transmission function of NAPOCOR. 
- It shall be wholly owned by PSALM
- It shall plan, construct, and centrally operate and maintain its high voltage transmission facilities, including
grid interconnections and ancillary services.
- Within 6 months from the effectivity of this Act, the transmission and subtransmission facilities of NAPOCOR and all other assets related to transmission operations, including the nationwide franchise of NAPOCOR for the operation of the transmission system and the grid, shall be transferred to the TRANSCO. 


The subtransmission functions and assets shall be segregated from the transmission functions, assets and liabilities for transparency and disposal as long as: 
- the subtransmission assets shall be operated and maintained by TRANSCO until their disposal to qualified distribution utilities which are in a position to take over the responsibility for operating, maintaining, upgrading, and expanding said assets.


All transmission and subtransmission related liabilities of NAPOCOR shall be transferred to and assumed by the PSALM Corp.

TRANSCO shall negotiate with and thereafter transfer such functions, assets, and associated liabilities to the qualified distribution utility or utilities connected to such subtransmission facilities notlater than two (2) years from the effectivity of this Act or the start of open access, whichever comes earlier:

The TRANSCO shall determine the disposal value of the subtransmission assets based on the revenue potential of such assets.

In case of disagreement in valuation, procedures, ownership participation and other issues, the ERC shall resolve such issues.

The take over by a distribution utility of any subtransmission asset shall not cause a diminution of service and quality to the end-users. Where there are two or more connected distribution utilities, the consortium or juridical entity shall be formed by and composed of all of them and thereafter shall be granted a franchise to operate the subtransmission asset by the ERC.

The subscription rights of each distribution utility involved shall be proportionate to their load requirements unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
