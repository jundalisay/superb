## Section 43. Functions of the ERC

The ERC shall promote competition, encourage market development, ensure customer choice and penalize abuse of market power in the restructured electricity industry. 

In appropriate cases, the ERC is authorized to issue cease and desist order after due notice and hearing. Towards this end, it shall be responsible for the following key functions in the restuctured industry:

- Enforce the implementing rules and regulations of this Act
- Within six (6) months from the effectivity of this Act, promulgate and enforce, in
accordance with law, a National Grid Code and a Distribution Code which shall include,
but not limited to, the following:
(i) Performance standards for TRANSCO O & M Concessionaire, distribution utilities
and suppliers: Provided, That in the establishment of the performance standards, the
nature and function of the entities shall be considered; and
(ii) Financial capability standards for the generating companies, the TRANSCO,
distribution utilities and suppliers: Provided, further, That such standards are set to
ensure that the electric power industry participants meet the minimum financial
standards to protect the public interest. Determine, fix, and approve, after due notice
and public hearings the universal charge, to be imposed on all electricity end-users
pursuant to Section 34 hereof.
(c) Enforce the rules and regulations governing the operations of the electricity spot market and
the activities of the spot market operator and other participants in the spot market, for the
purpose of ensuring a greater supply and rational pricing of electricity;
(d) Determine the level of cross subsidies in the existing retail rate until the same is removed
pursuant to Section 74 hereof;
(e) Amend or revoke, after due notice and hearing, the authority to operate of any person or entity
which fails to comply with the provisions hereof, the IRR or any order or resolution of the
ERC. In the event a divestment is required, the ERC shall allow the affected party sufficient
time to remedy the infraction or for an orderly disposal, but in no case exceed twelve (12)
months from the issuance of the order;
(f) In the public interest, establish and enforce a methodology for setting transmission and
distribution wheeling rates and retail rates for the captive market of a distribution utility,
taking intro account all relevant considerations, including the efficiency or inefficiency of theregulated entities. The rates must be such as to allow the recovery of just and reasonable costs
and a reasonable return on rate base (RORB) to enable the entity to operate viably. The ERC
may adopt alternative forms of internationally-accepted rate-setting methodology as it may
deem appropriate. The rate-setting methodology so adopted and applied must ensure a
reasonable price of electricity. The rates prescribed shall be non-discriminatory. To achieve
this objective and to ensure the complete removal of cross subsidies, the cap on the
recoverable rate of system losses prescribed in Section 10 of Republic Act No. 7832, is
hereby amended and shall be replaced by caps which shall be determined by the ERC based
on load density, sales mix, cost of service, delivery voltage and other technical considerations
it may promulgate. The ERC shall determine such form or rate-setting methodology, which
shall promote efficiency. In case the rate setting methodology used is RORB, it shall be
subject to the following guidelines:
(i) For purposes of determining the rate base, the TRANSCO or any distribution utility
may be allowed to revalue its eligible assets not more than once every three (3) years
by an independent appraisal company: Provided, however, That ERC may give an
exemption in case of unusual devaluation: Provided, further, That the ERC shall
exert efforts to minimize price shocks in order to protect the consumers;
(ii) Interest expenses are not allowable deductions from permissible return on rate base;
(iii) In determining eligible cost of services that will be passed on to the end-users, the
ERC shall establish minimum efficiency performance standards for the TRANSCO
and distribution utilities including systems losses, interruption frequency rates, and
collection efficiency;
(iv) Further, in determining rate base, the TRANSCO or any distribution utility shall not
be allowed to include management inefficiencies like cost of project delays not
excused by force majeure, penalties and related interest during construction
applicable to these unexcused delays; and
(v) Any significant operating costs or project investments of the TRANSCO and
distribution utilities which shall become part of the rate base shall be subject to
verification by the ERC to ensure that the contracting and procurement of the
equipment, assets and services have been subjected to transparent and accepted
industry procurement and purchasing practices to protect the public interest.
(g) Three (3) years after the imposition of the universal charge, ensure that the charges of the
TRANSCO or any distribution utility shall bear no cross subsidies between grids, within
grids, or between classes of customers, except as provided herein;
(h) Review and approve any changes on the terms and conditions of service of the TRANSCO or
any distribution utility;
(i) Allow the TRANSCO to charge user fees for ancillary services to all electric power industry
participants or self-generating entities connected to the grid. Such fees shall be fixed by the
ERC after due notice and public hearing;
(j) Set a lifeline rate for the marginalized end-users;

copies of such reports available to any interested party upon payment of a charge which
reflects the printing costs. The ERC shall publish all its decisions involving rates and anti-
competitive cases in at least one (1) newspaper of general circulation, and/or post
electronically and circulate to all interested electric power industry participants copies of its
resolutions to ensure fair and impartial treatment;
(o) Monitor the activities in the generation and supply of the electric power industry with the end
in view of promoting free market competition and ensuring that the allocation or pass through
of bulk purchase cost by distributors is transparent, non-discriminatory and that any existing
subsidies shall be divided pro-rata among all retail suppliers;
(p) Act on applications for or modifications of certificates of public convenience and/or necessity,
licenses or permits of franchised electric utilities in accordance with law and revoke, review
and modify such certificates, licenses or permits in appropriate cases, such as in cases of
violations of the Grid Code, Distribution Code and other rules and regulations issued by the
ERC in accordance with law;
(q) Act on applications for cost recovery and return on demand side management projects;
(r) In the exercise of its investigative and quasi-judicial powers, act against any participant or
player in the energy sector for violations of any law, rule and regulation governing the same,

the successful restructuring and modernization of the electric power industry, such as, but not
limited to, the rules and guidelines under which generation companies, distribution utilities
which are not publicly listed shall offer and sell to the public a portion not less than fifteen
percent (15%) of their common shares of stocks: Provided, however, That generation
companies, distribution utilities or their respective holding companies that are already listed in
the PSE are deemed in compliance. For existing companies, such public offering shall be
implemented not later than five (5) years from the effectivity of this Act. New companies

functions and responsibilities and over all cases involving disputes between and among
participants or players in the energy sector.
