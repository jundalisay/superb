### Section 24. Relevant Market

For purposes of determining the relevant market, the following factors, among others, affecting the substitutability among goods or services constituting such market and the geographic area delineating the boundaries of the market shall be considered:

(a) The possibilities of substituting the goods or services in question, with others of domestic or foreign origin, considering the technological possibilities, extent to which substitutes are available to consumers and time required for such substitution;

(b) The cost of distribution of the good or service, its raw materials, its supplements and substitutes from other areas and abroad, considering freight, insurance, import duties and non-tariff restrictions; the restrictions imposed by economic agents or by their associations; and the time required to supply the market from those areas;

(c) The cost and probability of users or consumers seeking other markets; and

(d) National, local or international restrictions which limit access by users or consumers to alternate sources of supply or the access of suppliers to alternate consumers.

Section 25. Control of an Entity. – In determining the control of an entity, the Commission may consider the following:

Control is presumed to exist when the parent owns directly or indirectly, through subsidiaries, more than one half (1/2) of the voting power of an entity, unless in exceptional circumstances, it can clearly be demonstrated that such ownership does not constitute control. Control also exists even when an entity owns one half (1/2) or less of the voting power of another entity when:

(a) There is power over more than one half (1/2) of the voting rights by virtue of an agreement with investors;

(b) There is power to direct or govern the financial and operating policies of the entity under a statute or agreement;

(c) There is power to appoint or remove the majority of the members of the board of directors or equivalent governing body;

(d) There is power to cast the majority votes at meetings of the board of directors or equivalent governing body;

(e) There exists ownership over or the right to use all or a significant part of the assets of the entity;

(f) There exist rights or contracts which confer decisive influence on the decisions of the entity.

Section 26. Determination of Anti-Competitive Agreement or Conduct. – In determining whether anti-competitive agreement or conduct has been committed, the Commission shall:

(a) Define the relevant market allegedly affected by the anti-competitive agreement or conduct, following the principles laid out in Section 24 of this Chapter;

(b) Determine if there is actual or potential adverse impact on competition in the relevant market caused by the alleged agreement or conduct, and if such impact is substantial and outweighs the actual or potential efficiency gains that result from the agreement or conduct;

(c) Adopt a broad and forward-looking perspective, recognizing future market developments, any overriding need to make the goods or services available to consumers, the requirements of large investments in infrastructure, the requirements of law, and the need of our economy to respond to international competition, but also taking account of past behavior of the parties involved and prevailing market conditions;

(d) Balance the need to ensure that competition is not prevented or substantially restricted and the risk that competition efficiency, productivity, innovation, or development of priority areas or industries in the general interest of the country may be deterred by overzealous or undue intervention; and

(e) Assess the totality of evidence on whether it is more likely than not that the entity has engaged in anti-competitive agreement or conduct including whether the entity’s conduct was done with a reasonable commercial purpose such as but not limited to phasing out of a product or closure of a business, or as a reasonable commercial response to the market entry or conduct of a competitor.

Section 27. Market Dominant Position. – In determining whether an entity has market dominant position for purposes of this Act, the Commission shall consider the following:

(a) The share of the entity in the relevant market and whether it is able to fix prices unilaterally or to restrict supply in the relevant market;

(b) The existence of barriers to entry and the elements which could foreseeably alter both said barriers and the supply from competitors;

(c) The existence and power of its competitors;

(d) The possibility of access by its competitors or other entities to its sources of inputs;

(e) The power of its customers to switch to other goods or services;

(f) Its recent conducts; and

(g) Other criteria established by the regulations of this Act.

There shall be a rebuttable presumption of market dominant position if the market share of an entity in the relevant market is at least fifty percent (50%), unless a new market share threshold is determined by the Commission for that particular sector.

The Commission shall from time to time determine and publish the threshold for dominant position or minimum level of share in the relevant market that could give rise to a presumption of dominant position. In such determination, the Commission would consider the structure of the relevant market, degree of integration, access to end-users, technology and financial resources, and other factors affecting the control of a market, as provided in subsections (a) to (g) of this section.

The Commission shall not consider the acquiring, maintaining and increasing of market share through legitimate means not substantially preventing, restricting, or lessening competition in the market such as but not limited to having superior skills, rendering superior service, producing or distributing quality products, having business acumen, and the enjoyment and use of protected intellectual property rights as violative of this Act.

Section 28. Forbearance. – The Commission may forbear from applying the provisions of this Act, for a limited time, in whole or in part, in all or specific cases, on an entity or group of entities, if in its determination:

(a) Enforcement is not necessary to the attainment of the policy objectives of this Act;

(b) Forbearance will neither impede competition in the market where the entity or group of entities seeking exemption operates nor in related markets; and

(c) Forbearance is consistent with public interest and the benefit and welfare of the consumers.

A public hearing shall be held to assist the Commission in making this determination.

The Commission’s order exempting the relevant entity or group of entities under this section shall be made public. Conditions may be attached to the forbearance if the Commission deems it appropriate to ensure the long-term interest of consumers.

In the event that the basis for the issuance of the exemption order ceases to be valid, the order may be withdrawn by the Commission.
