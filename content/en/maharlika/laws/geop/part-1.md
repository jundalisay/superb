Section 2 of RA 7638 (DOE Act of 1992) mandates the DOE to prepare, integrate, coordinate, supervise and control all plans, programs, projects and activities of the Government relative to energy exploration, development, utilization, distribution and conservation.

RA 9513 (An Act Promoting the Development, Utilization and Commercialization of Renewable Energy Resources and For Other Purposes “RE Act"), declares as a policy of the State to accelerate the exploration and development of Renewable Energy (RE) Resources to achieve energy self-reliance through the adoption of sustainable energy development strategies.

Section 9 of the RE Act provides that the DOE shall establish a GEOP which provides end-users the option to choose RE
Resources as their sources of energy.

18 July 2018, the DOE issued Department Circular (DC) No. DCZO18-07-0019. entitled “Promulgatlng the Rules and Guidelines Governing the Establishment of the Green Energy Option Program Pursuant to Renewable Energy Act of 2008," establishing the GEOP (the "GEOP Rules”).

The second paragraph of Section 11(a)(i) of the GEOP Rules provides that the DOE shall, after conduct of public consultations, promulgate the necessary guidelines and procedures for issuance of permits to RE Suppliers.

The DOE and the National Renewable Energy Board (NREB) conducted a series of public consultations on the draft GEOP Operating Permit Guidelines on 18 June 2019, 27 June 2019, 11 July 2019 and 25 July 2019 in Cebu, Davao, Batangas
and Pampanga, respectively.
