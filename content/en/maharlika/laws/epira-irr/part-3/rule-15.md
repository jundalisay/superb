Section 1. Referencing Section 36  and Rule 10 on Structural and Functional Unbundling of Electric Power Industry Participants

This Rule on the Unbundling of Rates shall result in the identification and separation of the individual charge for providing a specific electric service to any End-user for generation, transmission, distribution, and supply.

Section 2. Scope of Application.

This Rule shall apply to all Electric Power Industry Participants that are currently engaged or will be engaged in any of the business activities as stated in Section 5 .

Section 3. Parameters for Unbundling Rates and Costs of Service.
(a) An Electric Power Industry Participant shall identify, separate and
unbundle its rates, charges, and costs in accordance with Rule 10 on
Structural and Functional Unbundling of Electric Power Industry
Participants.
(b) In the determination of eligible costs of service to be charged to the
End-users, the ERC shall establish the minimum efficiency standards
covering the technical, financial, and customer service performance
criteria including systems losses, and interruption frequency rates
parameters among others.
(c) The rate base of the TRANSCO or its Buyer or Concessionaire or any
Distribution Utility shall exclude management inefficiencies, such as
but not limited to cost of project delays not due to any force majeure,
and penalties and related interest during construction and other
disallowances to be determined by ERC.
(d) Interest expenses shall not be allowed as deductions from permissible
Return on Rate Base (RORB).

TRANSCO or its Buyer or Concessionaire and DUs
may directly or indirectly engage in any related business which
maximizes the utilization of their assets.
Section 4.
Method of Rate Unbundling.
The ERC shall prescribe the methodology for rate unbundling.
Section 5.
(a)
Ratemaking Design and Methodology.
The ERC shall, in the public interest, establish and enforce a
methodology for setting transmission and distribution wheeling rates
and Retail Rates for the Captive Market of a Distribution Utility,
taking into account all relevant considerations, including the
efficiency or inefficiency of the regulated entities, as well as the
expansion or improvement of the Transmission facilities pursuant to a
plan approved by the ERC under Section 10 of Rule 6 on
Transmission Sector, and the DUs under Rule 7 on
Distribution Sector. The rates must be such as to allow the recovery
of just and reasonable costs and a reasonable RORB to enable the
entity to operate viably. The ERC may adopt alternative forms of
internationally-accepted rate-setting methodology as it may deem
appropriate. The rate-setting methodology so adopted and applied
must ensure a reasonable price of electricity. The rates prescribed
shall be non-discriminatory and shall take into consideration, among
others, the franchise tax. To achieve this objective and to ensure the
complete removal of cross subsidies, the cap on the recoverable rate of
system losses prescribed in Section 10 of Republic Act No. 7832, is
hereby amended and shall be replaced by caps which shall be
determined by the ERC based on load density, sales mix, cost of
service, delivery voltage and other technical considerations it may
promulgate. The ERC shall determine such form of rate-setting
methodology, which shall promote efficiency. In case the rate setting
methodology used is RORB, it shall be subject to the following
guidelines:
(i) For purposes of determining the rate base, the TRANSCO or its
Buyer or Concessionaire or any Distribution Utility may be
allowed to revalue its eligible assets not more than once every
three (3) years by an independent appraisal company: Provided,
however, That ERC may give an exemption in case of unusual
devaluation: Provided, further, That the ERC shall exert efforts
to minimize price shocks in order to protect the consumers;
(ii) Interest expenses are not allowable deductions from permissible
RORB;
(iii) In determining eligible cost of services that will be passed on to
the End-users, the ERC shall establish minimum efficiency
performance standards for the TRANSCO or its Buyer or
Concessionaire and DUs including systems
losses, interruption frequency rates, and collection efficiency;
Further, in determining rate base, the TRANSCO or its Buyer or
Concessionaire or any Distribution Utility shall not be allowed
(iv)
Page 51 of 100to include management inefficiencies like cost of project delays
not excused by force majeure, penalties and related interest
during construction applicable to these unexcused delays;
(b)
(v) Any significant operating costs or project investments of the
TRANSCO or its Buyer or Concessionaire and Distribution
Utilities which shall become part of the rate base shall be
subject to verification by the ERC to ensure that the contracting
and procurement of the equipment, assets and services have
been subjected to transparent and accepted industry
procurement and purchasing practices to protect the public
interest; and
(vi) The interest incurred during construction may be capitalized
and included in the rate base upon commissioning of the asset.
The Retail Rates charged by DUs for the Supply of
Electricity in their Captive Market shall be subject to regulation by the
ERC based on the principle of full recovery of prudent and reasonable
economic costs incurred, or such other principles that will promote
efficiency as may be determined by the ERC.
Every Distribution Utility or Supplier to the Contestable Market,
whichever is applicable, shall identify and segregate in its bills to End-
users the components of the Retail Rate as follows: generation,
transmission, distribution, supply and other related charges for
electric service.
(c) In the case of isolated, remote and Unviable Areas serviced by a
qualified third party as defined in Rule 14 on Provision of Electricity
by Qualified Third Parties, the ERC shall set the rules for rates
computation and determination.
(d) The ERC shall recognize the different cost structures in serving
isolated areas.

Section 6. Unbundled Rate Filing Requirements.

(a) As required by the Act, NAPOCOR and DUs shall file within
six (6) months from the effectivity  for revised rates with
costs and other relevant accounts unbundled by business activity.
(b) The ERC shall within six (6) months from the date of submission of
revised rates by the Distribution Utility, notify the Distribution Utility
of the action taken on the application.
(c) The rate filing petition shall commence with the unbundling the cost
components of the historical test year costs, from which the new
Retail Rates and unbundled rates or charges are to be developed. The
historical test year, for this purpose, shall be the twelve (12) months
ending 31 December 2000.
Page 52 of 100(d)
Each rate filing petition for unbundled cost of service shall contain
detailed schedules, data, and other relevant information deemed
necessary by the ERC.
