## Rule 16: The Removal of Cross

Section 1

As per Section 74 , cross subsidies within a Grid, between Grids, and/or classes of customers shall be phased out in a period not exceeding three (3) years from the establishment by the ERC of a Universal
Charge which shall be collected from all electricity End-users. Such level of
cross subsidies shall be made transparent and identified separately in the
billing statements provided to End-users by the Suppliers.

Section 2. Scope of Application.

This Rule shall apply to NAPOCOR, TRANSCO or its Buyer or Concessionaire, DUs and PSALM.

Section 3. Calculation of Cross Subsidies.

(a) The ERC may extend the period for the removal of cross subsidies for
a maximum period of one (1) year upon finding that cessation of such
mechanism would have a material adverse effect upon the public
interest, particularly the residential End-user; or would have an
immediate, irreparable, and adverse financial effect on Distribution
Utility.
(b) The cross subsidy between Grids in the rates of NAPOCOR shall be
calculated on a net basis for each Grid as the difference between:
(c)
(i) The total revenues that would have been collected on the Grid
under the rates in effect during a historical test year that is
adjusted for differences between actual and forecast
consumption and other factors as ERC may specify; and
(ii) The total unbundled true cost of service on the Grid as
submitted in accordance with Rule 15 on Unbundling of Rates
and the rate filing requirements that the ERC may issue
pursuant to Rule 15, using the same historical test year.
The cross subsidy within each Grid in the rates of NAPOCOR shall be
calculated on a net basis for each customer class within the Grid as
the difference between:
(i) The total revenues that would have been collected from a
customer class under the rates in effect during a historical test
year that is adjusted for differences between actual and forecast
consumption and other factors as ERC may specify; and
(ii) The total unbundled true cost of service for the same customer
class as submitted in accordance with Rule 15 on Unbundling
Page 53 of 100of Rates and the rate filing requirements that ERC may issue
pursuant to Rule 15, using the same historical test year.
(d)
The cross subsidy between customer classes within each Distribution
Utility shall be calculated on a net basis for each customer class as
the difference between:
(i) The total revenues that would have been collected from a
customer class under the rates in effect during a historical test
year that is adjusted for differences between actual and forecast
consumption and other factors as ERC may specify; and
(ii) The total unbundled true cost of service for the customer class
as submitted in accordance with Rule 15 on Unbundling of
Rates and the rate filing requirements that ERC may issue
using the same test year.
Section 4. Procedures for Handling Cross Subsidies.
(a) Pending the complete removal of cross subsidies, each subsidy rate
level shall be shown as a separate item in customer billing
statements.
(b) The ERC shall establish a cross subsidy charge to account for all
forms of cross subsidies that remain during the phase out period as
described in Section 5 of this Rule, to be recovered from all electricity
End-users through the Universal Charge pursuant to Rule 18 on the
Universal Charge.
Section 5. Scheme for Phasing Out Cross Subsidies.
(a) The ERC shall issue a scheme for phasing out all cross subsidies,
including subsidies within Grids, between Grids, and between classes
of customers. The phasing out period shall not exceed three (3) years
from the establishment of the Universal Charge pursuant to Rule 18
on Universal Charge. The initial implementation of the phase out
scheme shall occur on the next billing period after issuance of ERC
approval.
(b) The phase out scheme shall be designed to mitigate the effects of the
removal of the cross subsidies. The ERC shall determine which End-
users shall continue to receive subsidies and the level of subsidies
such End-users shall receive during the phase out period.
(c) Together with their filings of unbundled rates reflecting the true costs
of service, pursuant to Rule 15 on Unbundling of Rates, NAPOCOR and the
DUs shall file with ERC their proposals for the
removal of cross subsidies among the End-users they serve to be
considered by ERC in the formulation of the phase out scheme.
(d) The ERC may extend the period for the removal of cross subsidies for
a maximum period of one (1) year upon finding that cessation of such
mechanism would have a material adverse effect upon the public
interest, particularly the residential End-user; or would have an
Page 54 of 100immediate, irreparable, and adverse financial effect on a Distribution
Utility. DUs shall submit to ERC such information as
ERC may specify to help it determine if the cross subsidy removal
mechanism should be extended under this provision.
- If ERC does not extend the period for removal of cross subsidies, the
cross subsidies between regions, within regions, and between
customer classes shall cease to exist at the end of the three (3) year
period from the establishment of the Universal Charge.
Section 6. Exemption from Cross Subsidy Removal for Distribution
Utilities.
The threshold consumption levels and the Lifeline Rates determined by the
ERC shall be exempted from the prohibition on cross subsidies between
classes of customers of a Distribution Utility for a period of ten (10) years,
unless extended by law.
