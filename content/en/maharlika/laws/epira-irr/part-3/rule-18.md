the PSALM shall retain the balance within the STF to pay for periods
where a shortfall occurs.
(g) In determining the amount which a Distribution Utility can net off
from its remittance of the Universal Charge to PSALM, the
Distribution Utility shall not discriminate in its own favor at the
expense of other beneficiaries in the event that actual collections differ
from expected collections based on the level of kilowatt-hour sales
used by ERC in setting the Universal Charge per kilowatt-hour (kwh).
In such cases, the Distribution Utility shall only retain its
proportionate share in the actual collection.
