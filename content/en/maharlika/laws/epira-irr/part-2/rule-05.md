Section 4. Obligations of a Generation Company.
(a)
(b)

A COC shall be secured from the ERC before commercial operation of
a new Generation Facility. The COC shall stipulate all obligations of a
Generation Company consistent with this Section and such other
operating guidelines as ERC may establish. The ERC shall establish
and publish the standards and requirements for issuance of a COC.
A COC shall be issued upon compliance with such standards and
requirements.
(i) A Person owning an existing Generation Facility or a Generation
Facility under construction, shall submit within ninety (90)
days from effectivity of these Rules to ERC, when applicable, a
certificate of DOE/NAPOCOR accreditation, a three (3) year
operational history, a general company profile and other
information that ERC may require. Upon making a complete
submission to the ERC, such Person shall be issued a COC by
the ERC to operate such existing Generation Facility.
(ii) A Generation Facility which has been previously issued a COC
shall not be required to secure a COC even if acquired by a new
owner: Provided, That such new owner shall register with ERC
as specified above. Upon registration, such Person shall be
deemed authorized to operate such Generation Facility.

A Generation Company shall comply with the following operating
standards:
(i)
Technical Standards.
A Generation Company shall ensure that all its facilities
connected to the Grid meet the technical design and operational
Page 20 of 100criteria of the Grid Code and Distribution Code promulgated by
ERC, Philippine Electrical Code, and the TRANSCO or its Buyer
or Concessionaire including, among others, standards for
voltage fluctuation, frequency, harmonics, security, reliability,
unplanned outages and provision of Ancillary Services and shall
operate in accordance with such operational criteria.
(ii)
Financial Standards.
A Generation Company with facilities connected to the Grid
shall conform to the financial standards provided in the Grid
Code. These standards shall take into consideration the nature
and function of a Generation Facility. Furthermore, such
standards are set to ensure that the Generation Company
meets the minimum financial standards to protect the public
interest and any customer procuring services from the said
Generation Company.
(iii)
Environmental Standards.
A Generation Company shall ensure that its facilities comply
with applicable environmental laws, rules and regulations.
(c) A Generation Company operating a Generation Facility in isolated
areas shall meet the technical and financial standards to be issued by
the ERC using applicable and practicable criteria within two (2) years,
or such other period as may be specified by the ERC, from the
issuance of such technical and financial standards.
(d) A Generation Company shall structurally and functionally unbundle
its generation business activities and rates from its distribution and
supply businesses as provided in Rule 10 on Structural and
Functional Unbundling of Electric Power Industry Participants and
Rule 15 on Unbundling of Rates.
(e) Prior to the implementation of Open Access and Retail Competition,
the prices charged by a Generation Company for the Supply of
Electricity shall be subject to ERC regulation on the Retail Rates
charged by DUs and transition supply contracts
(TSCs) as specified in Section 67 .
Upon introduction of Open Access and Retail Competition or
establishment of WESM, whichever comes first, the rates of a
Generation Company shall not be subject to regulation by the ERC
except as otherwise provided by the Act.
However, for a Generation Company operating a facility in SPUG areas
and isolated areas, the generation rates for such facility shall be fixed
and determined by ERC as set forth in Rule 13 on Missionary
Electrification.
(f) A self-generation company not connected to a Distribution Utility,
unless otherwise provided under these Rules, shall remit directly to
TRANSCO the corresponding Universal Charge set by ERC.
In relation to this, TRANSCO or its Buyer or Concessionaire or the
appropriate Distribution Utility, when connected to the self-generation
company, shall have access to the customer side of the meter in order
to determine the utilization of such Generation Facility for the
purpose of assessing the corresponding Universal Charge as provided
in Rule 18 on Universal Charge.

(g) A Generation Company shall comply with Rule 29 on Benefits to Host
Communities.

(h) Upon the establishment of the WESM by the DOE, jointly with

facilities connected to a Grid shall make information available to the
Market Operator to enable the Market Operator to implement the
appropriate dispatch scheduling and shall comply with the said
scheduling in accordance with the WESM Rules. A Generation
Company shall likewise make information available to the grid
operator to facilitate Central Dispatch by the grid operator. 

Subject to Technical Constraints, the grid operator of the TRANSCO or its Buyer
or Concessionaire shall provide Central Dispatch to a Generation
Facility connected, directly or indirectly, to the transmission system in
accordance with the dispatch schedule submitted by the Market
Operator, which schedule shall take into account outstanding
bilateral contracts.

Ownership, Market Abuse and Anti-Competitive Behavior.

required for competitive purposes as prescribed in Section 5 (b) of this
Rule.
(l) A Generation Company shall submit to DOE any information as may
be required by the DOE for the preparation of the PDP, subject to
appropriate measures to preserve the confidentiality of proprietary or
commercially sensitive information.
(m) A Generation Company that fails to comply with any of these
obligations, including compliance with technical standards, shall be
subject to fines and penalties as may be imposed by the ERC.
Section 5. Dedicated Point-to-Point Limited Transmission Facility of a
Generation Company.
(a)
Subject to prior authorization from ERC, TRANSCO or its Buyer or
Concessionaire may allow a Generation Company to develop, own
and/or operate dedicated point-to-point limited transmission
facilities: Provided, That:

required only for the purpose of connecting to the Grid which
will be used solely by the Generation Facility, and are not used
to serve End-users or Suppliers directly;

(ii) The facilities are included and consistent with the TDP as
certified by TRANSCO or its Buyer or Concessionaire; and

(iii) Any other documents that may be required by the ERC.

In the event that such assets are required for competitive purposes, ownership of the same shall be transferred to the TRANSCO at a fair market price. In case of disagreement on the fair market price, the
ERC shall determine the fair market value of such asset, either directly
or through such dispute resolution mechanisms as ERC may specify.

Section 6. Generation Charges and VAT.

(a) Within 90 days from the effectivity of these Rules, the ERC shall issue guidelines for the regulation of power sales by Generation Companies applicable prior to the implementation of Retail
Competition and Open Access or establishment of WESM, whichever
comes first.

(b) As per the policy of reducing electricity rates to End-users, sales of generated power by a Generation Company shall, from the effectivity , be zero-rated for the purpose of imposition of
value-added tax. 

Towards this end, 0% VAT shall apply to the sale of generated power by a Generation Company through all stages of sale until it reaches the End-user. The DOF, through the BIR, shall issue the necessary revenue regulation
within sixty (60) calendar days from effectivity of these Rules.
