## RULE 6. TRANSMISSION SECTOR

Section 1. Guiding Principle

The transmission of electric power <!-- is affected with public interest and --> shall be a regulated common electricity carrier business, subject to the ratemaking powers of the ERC.

Section 2. Scope of Application

This Rule shall apply to TRANSCO or its Buyer or Concessionaire and any other successor-in-interest thereto.

Section 3. Ownership Limitation

The TRANSCO or its Buyer or Concessionaire or any of its stockholders, directors, officers or any of their relatives within the fourth civil degree of consanguinity or affinity, legitimate or common law, shall not hold any interest, whether directly or indirectly, in any Generation Company, Distribution Utility, IPP Administrator and Supplier.

Section 4. Separation Between Transmission and Subtransmission.

The ERC shall set the standards of the transmission voltages and other factors that shall distinguish transmission assets from Subtransmission Assets. 

Towards this end, ERC shall issue appropriate guidelines to distinguish between these categories of assets according to voltage level and function. The ERC shall take into account the objective of allowing non-
discriminatory Open Access to the transmission and Subtransmission Systems.

The technical and functional criteria to be considered in distinguishing transmission assets from Subtransmission Assets shall include, but not limited to:
(a) Subtransmission Assets are normally in close proximity to retail
customers;
(b) Subtransmission Assets are primarily radial in character;
(c) Power flows into Subtransmission Assets; it rarely, if ever, flows out;
(d) When power enters Subtransmission Assets, it is not reconsigned or
transported on to some other market;
(e) Power entering Subtransmission Assets
comparatively restricted geographic area;
(f) Meters are based at the interface of transmission and
Subtransmission Assets to measure flows into the Subtransmission
Assets; and
(g) Subtransmission Assets will be of reduced voltage.
is consumed in a

Section 5. Initial Classification of Transmission Assets.

Pending the issuance of the new standards for classification of transmission assets by ERC, transmission assets shall be defined as follows:

- For the Luzon Grid, transmission facilities rated 230 kV and above shall generally be considered transmission assets;
(b) For the Visayas Grid, transmission facilities rated 69 kV and above
shall generally be considered transmission assets;
(c) For the Mindanao Grid, transmission facilities rated 138 kV and
above shall generally be considered transmission assets; and
(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, any line at the specified
level for each Grid that serves an End-user or customer shall be
considered a subtransmission line, and any line below the specified
Page 24 of 100level for each Grid that serves a transmission function shall be
considered a transmission line.
Section 6. Initial Classification of Subtransmission Assets.
Step-down transformers used solely by load customers are considered
Subtransmission Assets. .
In the case of step-down transformer banks serving a single Distribution
Utility, the Distribution Utility or DUs shall have the option
to purchase said facility, provided, it will guarantee the reliable Supply of
Electricity to grid control equipment.
Section 7.
Functions and Responsibilities of TRANSCO or its
Buyer or Concessionaire.
The TRANSCO or its Buyer or Concessionaire shall have, among others, the
following functions and responsibilities:
(a) Act as the system operator of the nationwide electrical transmission
and Subtransmission System, transferred to it by NAPOCOR;
(b) Provide open and non-discriminatory access to its system to all
electricity users;
(c) Ensure and maintain the reliability, adequacy, security, stability and
integrity of the Grid in accordance with the performance standards for
the operation and maintenance of the Grid, as set forth in the Grid
Code and the Distribution Code.
The performance indicators for reliability, security, adequacy, integrity
and stability shall include but are not limited to the following:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)
(vi)
(vii)
(viii)
(ix)
(x)
Number of Interruption Events;
Sustained Average Interruption Frequency Index;
Momentary Average Interruption Frequency Index;
Sustained Average Interruption Duration Index;
System Interruption Severity Index;
Frequency of tripping per 100 c-km;
Average Forced Outage Duration;
Accumulated Time Error;
Frequency Limit Violation; and
Voltage limit Violations.

(d) Improve and expand its transmission facilities, consistent with the
TDP and the Grid Code, to adequately serve Generation Companies,
DUs and Suppliers requiring transmission service
and/or Ancillary Services through the transmission system.
TRANSCO or its Buyer or Concessionaire shall submit any plan for
expansion or improvement of its facilities for approval by the ERC
(e) Provide Central Dispatch, through its grid operator, to all Generation
Facilities and loads connected, directly or indirectly, to the
Page 25 of 100transmission system in accordance with the dispatch schedule
submitted by the Market Operator, taking into account outstanding
bilateral contracts and subject to Technical Constraints.

Section 8. Obligations of TRANSCO.

The TRANSCO shall have, among others, the following obligations:
(a) Prepare the TDP in consultation with Electric Power Industry
Participants.
(b) Submit an updated TDP for approval to the DOE on a timely basis
each year for integration with the PDP and PEP.
(c) Remit its net profit, if any, to the PSALM not later than ninety (90)
days after the immediately preceding quarter subject to annual
reconciliation when the audited and certified annual financial
statements are finally made available. Net profit is defined as:
Net Profit = Total Utility Revenue â€“ (Total Operating Expenses - Other
Income + Interest & Other Charges)
Net proceeds from the Privatization of TRANSCO shall be immediately
remitted to PSALM.
(d) TRANSCO shall secure approval of its Transmission Charges from the
ERC pursuant to Section 43(f) .
(e) TRANSCO shall sell its Subtransmission Assets to qualified
DUs pursuant to the Act and, Part IV, Section 13 of
Rule 22 on National Transmission Corporation. In the event that a
Distribution Utility is not qualified or a qualified Distribution Utility
refuses to acquire such assets, then TRANSCO shall be deemed in

facilities in order to ensure and maintain the reliability, adequacy, security,
stability and integrity of the Grid and adequately serve Electric Power
Industry Participants requiring transmission service or Ancillary Services
through the Grid.

Section 10. Transmission Development Plan

(a)
The TDP refers to a plan for managing the transmission system
through efficient planning for expansion, upgrading, rehabilitation,
repair and maintenance, to be prepared and implemented by
TRANSCO or its Buyer or Concessionaire.
Page 26 of 100(b) TRANSCO or its Buyer or Concessionaire shall be responsible for the
