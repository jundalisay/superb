## Section 3. Prohibition of Cross Ownership.

{{< s v="a" >}} As per Section 45, no Generation Company, IPP Administrators, Distribution Utility or Supplier, their respective
subsidiaries, Affiliates, stockholders, directors or officers or other entity engaged in generating and supplying electricity specified by ERC, shall hold any interest, directly or indirectly, in the TRANSCO or
its Buyer or Concessionaire, or the Market Operator.

b) TRANSCO or its Buyer or Concessionaire and any of its stockholders,
directors or officers or any of their relatives within the fourth civil
degree of consanguinity or affinity, legitimate or common law, shall
not hold any interest, whether directly or indirectly, in any Generation
Company, IPP Administrators, Distribution Utility or Supplier.
(c) Except for ex officio government-appointed representatives, no Person
who is an officer or director of the TRANSCO or its Buyer or
Concessionaire shall be an officer or director of any Generation
Company, IPP Administrators, Distribution Utility or Supplier.
(d) This Section shall not apply to PSALM in the course of its
Privatization of NAPOCOR assets pursuant to Sec. 47 .
Section 4. Limits on Concentration of Ownership,
Control of Installed Generating Capacity.
Operation
or
(a) No company, Related Group or IPP Administrator, singly or in
combination, can own, operate or Control more than thirty percent
(30 %) of the installed generating capacity of a Grid and/or twenty-five
percent (25%) of the national installed generating capacity: Provided,
That such restrictions shall not apply to PSALM or NAPOCOR during the
time that its assets are being privatized pursuant to Section 47 of the
Act and isolated grids that are not connected to the high voltage
transmission system.
The ERC shall determine the installed
generating capacity in a Grid and the national installed generating
capacity.
(b) The capacity of such facility shall be credited to the entity controlling
the terms and conditions of the prices or quantities of the output of
such capacity sold in the market in cases where different entities own
the same Generation Facility.
In cases where different Persons own, operate or Control the same
Generation Facility, the capacity of such facility shall be credited to
the Person controlling the capacity of the Generation Facility.
Section 5. Limits on Bilateral Supply Contracts by a Distribution
Utility.
(a) A Distribution Utility may enter into bilateral power supply contracts
subject to the provisions of Section 5 of Rule 30 on NAPOCOR Offer of
Transition Supply Contracts and a review by the ERC: Provided, That
such review shall only be required for a Distribution Utility whose
level of Open Access has not reached household demand level.
(b) No Distribution Utility shall be allowed to source from bilateral power
supply contracts more than fifty percent (50%) of its total demand
from an Affiliate engaged in generation, but such limitation shall not
prejudice contracts entered into prior to the effective date .
Page 42 of 100This limitation shall apply regardless of whether demand is expressed
in terms of capacity or energy.
Section 6. Encouragement of Participation in the WESM.
For the first five (5) years from the establishment of the WESM, no
Distribution Utility shall source more than ninety percent (90%) of its total
demand from bilateral power supply contracts.
Section 7. ERC Responsibilities.
(a) ERC shall enforce the competitive safeguards specified in this Rule in
order to promote true market competition and prevent harmful
monopoly and market power abuse. However, ERC shall not apply
the limitations specified in this Rule to isolated grids that are not
connected to the Grid.
(b) ERC shall have the authority to determine the appropriate Grid or
Grids to use in the application of this Rule when two or more of the
three separate Grids become sufficiently interconnected to constitute
a single Grid or as conditions may otherwise permit.
(c) ERC shall, within one (1) year from the effectivity ,
promulgate Competition Rules to ensure and promote competition,
encourage market development and customer choice and discourage
or penalize abuse of market power, cartelization and any anti-
competitive or discriminatory behavior, or unfair trade practice that
distorts competition or harms consumers. Such Rules shall define
relevant markets for the purpose of establishing abuse or misuse of
market power, areas of isolated grids that are not connected to the
high voltage transmission system, and the reportorial requirements of
Electric Power Industry Participants as may be necessary to enforce
the provisions of Section 45 .
(d) ERC shall, motu proprio, monitor and penalize any market power
abuse or anti-competitive or unduly discriminatory act or behavior, or
any unfair trade practice that distorts competition or harms
consumers, by any Electric Power Industry Participant. Upon a
finding of a prima facie case that an Electric Power Industry
Participant has engaged in such act or behavior, the ERC shall after
due notice and hearing, stop and redress the same. Such remedies
shall, without limitation, include the separation of the business
activities of an Electric Power Industry Participant into different
juridical entities, the imposition of bid or price controls, issuance of
injunctions in accordance with the Rules of Court, divestment or
disgorgement of excess profits, and imposition of fines and penalties
pursuant to Section 46 .
(e) ERC shall, within one (1) year from the effectivity ,
promulgate rules and regulations providing for a complaint procedure
that, without limitation, provides the accused party with its rights to
due process.

Practices.
Behavior
and
Other
Unfair
Trade
The ERC shall promulgate Competition Rules prohibiting, and specifying
appropriate penalties and other remedies for, any contract, combination or
conspiracy that unreasonably restricts competition in any market for
electricity, or any conduct that constitutes an abuse of market power or an
attempted monopolization of any market for electricity, including but not
limited to the following:
(a) Fixing prices of products or services:
Electric Power Industry
Participants that are competitors shall not enter into any agreement
or understanding, tacit or explicit, to fix, peg or stabilize the price of
any product or service. Price fixing shall be deemed to include
agreements on bids, price floors, price ceilings, pricing formulas and
resale prices, and agreements on credit or any other terms of a
transaction between a buyer and a seller.
(b) Fixing output of products or services:
Electric Power Industry
Participants that are competitors shall not enter into any agreement
or understanding, tacit or explicit, to fix, limit or otherwise determine
their output of any product or service.
(c) Customer, Product, Service or Territorial Divisions: Electric Power
Industry Participants that are competitors shall not enter into any
agreement or understanding, tacit or explicit, as to the customers or
the geographic territories they will serve, or the products or services
they will sell.
(d) Tying: Electric Power Industry Participants shall not use a position of
market power to condition the sale of one product or service on the
purchase of another product or service. No Distribution Utility shall
make access to its Distribution System contingent upon the purchase
of generation, metering, billing or other services.
(e) Physical or Economic Withholding:
Electric Power Industry
Participants shall not use physical operating practices or bidding
strategies that limit the market participation of a generation unit
under conditions that will result in significant increases in market
prices.
(f) Discriminatory provision of regulated distribution or transmission
services: Regulated distribution and transmission services shall be
provided on a basis that is not unduly discriminatory. Examples of
unduly discriminatory behavior include, but not limited to the
following:
(i)
A Distribution Utility or TRANSCO or its Buyer or
Concessionaire refuses to interconnect Generation Company,
IPP Administrator, or Supplier other than for reasons of system
security or reliability or reasonable financial or credit
considerations pursuant to the Grid or Distribution Codes or
commission of acts constituting grounds for suspension of the
service under any applicable rule and regulation.
Page 44 of 100(ii) A Distribution Utility or TRANSCO or its Buyer or
Concessionaire gives a Generation Company, IPP Administrator,
or Supplier, including without limitation any of the Distribution
Utility’s Affiliates, any preference or advantage over any other
Generation Company, IPP Administrator, or Supplier in
processing a request for Transmission or Distribution of
Electricity.
(iii) A Distribution Utility or TRANSCO or its Buyer or
Concessionaire gives a Generation Company, IPP Administrator,
or Supplier, including without limitation any of the Distribution
Utility’s Affiliates, any preference or advantage in the
dissemination or disclosure of customer or transmission or
Distribution System information, and any such information that
has not been made available to all Electric Power Industry
Participants at the same time and in a non-discriminatory
manner.
(iv) A Distribution Utility or TRANSCO or its Buyer or
Concessionaire provides any preference or advantage to any
Supplier in the disclosure of information about operational
status and availability of the Distribution System and
transmission system.
(v) A Distribution Utility does not provide all regulated services,
and does not apply Distribution Wheeling Charges to any
Supplier that is not an Affiliate, in the same manner as it does
for itself or its Affiliates.
TRANSCO or its Buyer or
Concessionaire shall provide all regulated services and shall
apply Transmission Charges to any Electric Power Industry Participant in the same manner as it does for PSALM or NAPOCOR.

(g) Misrepresentation or false advertising of a Distribution Utility: A Distribution Utility or its Affiliate shall not state or imply that any distribution service provided to an Affiliate is inherently superior, solely on the basis of Affiliate’s relationship with the Distribution Utility, to that provided to any other Supplier.

(h) Cross-Subsidization: Consistent with Section 26 , a Distribution Utility shall not use its revenues or resources from regulated distribution services to reduce the cost or price of its competitive services (generation or supply).
