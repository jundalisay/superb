Section 1. Guiding Principle.

Consistent with the last paragraph of Section 36 , any Electric Power Industry Participant shall structurally and functionally unbundle its business activities in accordance with Section 5 , namely: generation, transmission, distribution and supply. Structural unbundling
shall mean the separation of different activities through the creation of separate divisions or departments within a single company or, at the option of any Electric Power Industry Participant, a separation into different
juridical entities, with a clear separation of accounts between regulated and
non-regulated business activities. Functional unbundling shall mean the
separation of functions into different components.

For this purpose, business activities resulting from the initial unbundling process may be
further unbundled to widen the scope for competitive activities. The ERC
shall formulate the appropriate guidelines and shall ensure full compliance
with this provision.


## Section 2. Scope of Application

This Rule shall apply to all Electric Power Industry Participants that are currently engaged or will be engaged in any of the following business activities:

(a) Power generation;
(b) Transmission;
c) Distribution;
(d) Supply of Electricity including collection and metering;
(e) Related businesses which utilize the generation, transmission,
distribution or supply assets for non-electricity related services; and
(f) Other electricity related services that may be identified and authorized
by the ERC.

The ERC may relax or eliminate the unbundling requirements for specified
business activities if such activity operates in a competitive market.

juridical separation of generation, distribution and supply as
provided for in the BSUP;
(iii) Milestones and highlights of the planned structural and

recommend modifications to the BSUP, or reject the BSUP for revision
and direct the concerned Electric Power Industry Participant to file a
new BSUP based on its comments. In any case, ERC shall render its
decision within six (6) months from filing of the BSUP.
(e) Upon receipt of the ERC decision, the Electric Power Industry
Participant shall implement said decision fully and promptly.
(f) The ERC shall provide for appropriate fines and penalties for any
Electric Power Industry Participant that fails to comply with its
decision in full.
Section 4. Guiding Principles for Business Separation of Distribution
Utilities.

activities, the Distribution System portion of its business shall no
longer provide competitive energy services, i.e. generation and supply.
A Distribution Utility, which has not structurally and functionally
unbundled its business activities shall be prohibited from operating in
a Contestable Market.
(b) ECs shall follow the structural and functional unbundling procedures
set forth in these Rules except that such unbundling shall be
implemented no later than 26 June 2006, the start of Retail
Competition and Open Access in the Franchise Areas of ECs.
