Section 2. Scope of Application

This Rule shall apply to affected personnel of DOE, ERB, NEA and NAPOCOR.

Section 3. Separation and Other Benefits.

(a) The separation benefit shall consist of either a separation pay and other benefits granted in accordance with existing laws, rules and regulations or a separation plan equivalent to one and one half (1-½)
months’ salary for every year of service in the government, whichever
is higher: Provided, That the separated or displaced employee has
rendered at least one (1) year of service at the time of effectivity of the
Act.

(b) The following shall govern the application of Section 3(a) of this Rule:

(i) With respect to NAPOCOR officials and employees, they shall be considered legally terminated and shall be entitled to the
benefits or separation pay provided in Section 3(a) herein when the restructuring plan as approved by the NAPOCOR Board shall have
been implemented.

(ii) With respect to NEA officials and employees, they shall be considered legally terminated and shall be entitled to the
benefits or separation pay provided in Section 3(a) herein when a restructuring of NEA is implemented pursuant to a law
enacted by Congress or pursuant to Section 5(a)(5) of Presidential Decree No. 269.
(iii) With respect to the affected Bureaus of the DOE, their officials
and employees shall be considered legally terminated and shall

Those who avail of the foregoing privileges shall start their government service anew if absorbed by any government agency or
any government-owned successor company.

honoraria, allowances and any other emoluments received in addition
to the basic pay under existing laws.

existing laws, as a result of the Restructuring of the electric power
industry or Privatization of NAPOCOR assets pursuant to the Act.
