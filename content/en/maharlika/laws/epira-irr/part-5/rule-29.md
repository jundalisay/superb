Section 3. Beneficiaries

Direct benefits shall be provided to the host LGU, especially the community and people affected while equitable preferential benefits shall be provided to the host region. Host LGU or host region shall be understood as follows: (a) With respect to Generation Facilities, in the case of power barges, the host LGU or region is that where the power barge is moored; in all
other cases, the host LGU or region is that where the Generation Facility is physically located. Generation Facilities shall not include transmission lines and substations.

The host LGU or region is that where the
producing geothermal reservoir is located as delineated by
geochemical, geophysical, and exploration surveys. “Producing
geothermal reservoir” refers to the subsurface geological
environment where the geothermal fluids accumulate and
circulate, inclusive of the production and re-injection/recharge

host LGU and host region in the preparation of annual work
programs/project proposals qualified by the DOE to be implemented
in any given year. The amount of financial benefits accruing to the
pertinent funds in the immediate preceding year shall be used as
basis in the preparation of annual work programs/project proposals.
The said annual work programs/project proposals shall be submitted
by the Generation Company and/or energy resource developer to the
DOE not later than March 15 of every year.
(b) All work programs/project proposals for DLF and RWMHEEF shall be
implemented within one (1) year upon receipt of funds. Said work
programs/project proposals shall be implemented, supervised and
administered by the concerned LGU.
(c) The Generation Company and/or energy resource developer shall
review the work programs/project proposals on development,
livelihood, reforestation, watershed management, health and/or
environment enhancement duly endorsed by the host LGU and host
region through a resolution passed by its Sanggunian or Regional
Development Council. In the case of official resettlement area, work
programs/project proposals may be endorsed by the resettlement
organization, association or cooperative duly certified by the
Generation Company and/or energy resource developer and registered
under the concerned government agencies. The Generation Company
and/or energy resource developer shall make the appropriate
endorsement of annual work programs/project proposals to the DOE
for further review and approval. The review and approval of annual
work programs/project proposals shall be completed by DOE within
twenty (20) working days upon receipt of complete documentation.

Sub-section (f)(i), hereof.
(d) For reforestation and watershed management projects, work
programs/project proposals should be coordinated and endorsed by
the DENR Regional Office or the watershed management
administrator in the area.
(e) For electrification programs, the Generation Company and/or energy
resource developer shall coordinate with the concerned Distribution
Utility in the development of said program for the barangays
energization and prioritization in any given year.
The annual
electrification programs shall be directly forwarded to DOE for review
and evaluation. The NEA shall assist the ECs in the preparation of
documents such as but not limited to the staking sheets or single line
diagrams and cost estimates. Thereafter, project implementation
shall proceed as prescribed under Sub-section (f)(ii), hereof. The
electrification projects may be undertaken by the Distribution Utility
or the Generation Company and/or energy resource developer or their
accredited contractors, herein referred to as project implementor.
Page 86 of 100(f)
Upon
submission
of
complete
documents
of
the
work
programs/project proposals, project implementation shall proceed in
any of the following manner:
(i) For
development,
livelihood,
reforestation,
watershed
management, health and/or environment enhancement
projects, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) shall be entered
into by and among the DOE, Generation Company and/or
energy resource developer, and the concerned LGU to effect
funds commitment and project implementation. The DOE shall
then make the necessary fund allocation and shall forthwith
release the project funds directly to the concerned host LGU or
host region within fifteen (15) days upon submission of
complete supporting documents pursuant to the provisions in
the MOA.
(ii) For electrification projects, a MOA shall be entered into by and
among the DOE, the concerned Distribution Utility/project
implementor, Generation Company and/or energy resource
developer
to
effect
funds
commitment
and
project
implementation. The DOE shall then make the necessary fund
allocation and shall forthwith release the funds to the
franchised Distribution Utility/project implementor within
fifteen (15) days upon submission of complete supporting
documents pursuant to the provisions in the MOA.
For projects to be undertaken by contract, initial release of fund
shall be equivalent to fifteen percent (15%) of the total approved
project cost. Subsequent release of fund balance shall be based
on the result of qualified lowest bid cost.
For projects to be undertaken by administration, total approved
project cost shall be released upon signing of the MOA.
(g)
All funds disbursements shall follow government accounting and
auditing rules and regulations.
Section 7.
Administration of Trust Accounts.

the DOE. All funds administered by NAPOCOR with regard to DLF and
RWMHEEF shall be transferred to DOE for administration within one
hundred twenty (120) days from the effectivity of these Rules.
Thereafter, all MOA entered into by DOE and NAPOCOR on the
establishment of trust accounts shall be amended to reflect transfer of
responsibilities to NAPOCOR-successors, transferees and/or assignees or
IPPs.
(b) The obligation of the Generation Companies to DOE with regard to the
remittance of funds shall be settled in the following manner:
(i)
For NAPOCOR-IPPs, if applicable, to settle all obligations before
issuance of COC/registration certificate by ERC.
Page 87 of 100(ii) For NAPOCOR, if applicable, to settle all obligations before
Privatization/sale and transfer of IPP contracts to PSALM.
(iii) For IPPs of DUs with an outstanding financial
obligation with the DOE pursuant to Department Circular No.
2000-03-03 shall settle its account within one (1) year upon
effectivity of these Rules.
(iv) After thorough investigation, non-remittance of the Generation
Company and/or energy resource developer of the financial
benefits due to the host communities shall be a ground for
DOE’s recommendation to ERC for appropriate action and
reasonable measures in accordance with ERC rules and
regulations.

Section 8. Audit of Financial Benefits and Project Monitoring.

a) The DOE shall review and audit the source of fund, particularly on
the total electricity sales of the Generation Facility to determine the
financial benefits due to the host LGUs and host regions.
(b) The DOE shall conduct financial and technical audit to monitor
compliance by the LGU and region with regard to the implementation
of the projects. In the event of unjustified disbursement of fund and
non-completion or delay in the implementation of projects by the LGU
or region concerned and the Distribution Utility/project implementor,
the DOE shall defer the releases of funds and take appropriate
reasonable measures in accordance with any existing and future
government rules and regulations until such time that the LGU or

be able to justify disbursement of funds to the satisfaction of the DOE
or deputized/resident auditor of the Commission on Audit (COA).
Section 9. Other Provisions.
(a) The application of this Rule 27(A) shall take effect upon effectivity of
these Rules.
