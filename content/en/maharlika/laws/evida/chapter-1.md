## GENERAL PROVISIONS

The State shall:
- a) Ensure the country’s energy security and independence by reducing reliance on imported fuel for the transportation sector
- b) Provide an enabling environment for the development of electric vehicles including options for micromobility as an attractive and feasible mode of transportation to reduce dependence on fossil fuels.
                                                                         

- c) Promote and support innovation in clean, sustainable, for vehicle propulsion and efficient energy to accelerate social progress and human development by encouraging public and private use of low emission and alternative energy

- d) Protect the health and well-being of the people from the hazards of pollution and the greenhouse effect

- e) Safeguard and improve the integrity, reliability, and 
stability of the country’s electric power grid by optimizing the location of energy sources relative to demand

- f) Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization while recognizing the private sector to:
  - support the transition to new technologies
  - generate jobs
  - spur SME growth
  - attract investments
  - grow globally competitive and innovative industries
  - upgrade the country’s participation in regional and global value chains, consistent with the Philippine Development Plan and the country’s international obligations under the UN Sustainable Development Agenda




## Section 4. Definitions

- a) Battery electric vehicle (BEV) is an electrically-propelled vehicle with only a traction battery as power source for propulsion

- b} Battery swapping station is a facility which allows electric vehicle users to exchange a near-empty discharged battery with a fully charged battery

- c) Centralized vehicle-to-grid facilities are establishments supplying power to the grid using electric vehicles

- (d) Certificate of Inspection is a document issued by the building ofﬁcial of an LGU as a requirement to install power lines to a building to certify the completeness of the installation of all electrical wirings, pursuant to RA 6541 (National Building Code) as revised by PD 1096. 

- e) Charging fee is the amount imposed on electric vehicle users in exchange for the use of commercial use charging stations. Its individual components shall be unbundled pursuant to DOE regulations
      
- g) Generate employment opportunities for our local skilled workforce to sustain their livelihood


- f) Charging station is a facility with equipment for the delivery of electrical energy to electric vehicles or its battery, installed in an enclosure with special control functions and communications, and may be located off the vehicle. Charging stations shall include battery swapping stations

- h) Protect and safeguard the country’s cultural heritage through the transportation system

- i) Recognize LGUs as as competent partners of the national government in the transition by providing them capacity-building support
