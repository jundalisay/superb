The CREVI shall provide a timeline for the gradual covered entities will all be EVs. In the implementation of this provision, the availability and sufﬁciency of energy supply and EV charging stations as well as other conditions affecting the optimal utilization of EVs shall be taken into consideration.



## Section 17. Dedicated Parking Slots for Electric Vehicles in Private and Public Buildings and Establishments

Private and public buildings and establishments constructed after the effectivity of this Act and pursuant to the National Building Code shall designate dedicated parking slots for the exclusive use of EVs to include light electric vehicles as long as the number of dedicated parking slots shall be proportional to the total number of parking slots within the building as long as existing private and public buildings and establishments shall comply with the foregoing requirements within the time frame indicated in the CREVI.

No permit shall be issued by the LGU for the construction or renovation of a building or establishment unless this section has been complied with.


## Section 18. Construction or Installation of Charging Stations in Dedicated Parking Slots

The CREVI shall determine when dedicated parking slots shall be installed with a charging station either by the owner of the building or establishment or a charging station service provider as long as the owner of the private or public building or establishment shall have the first priority to install, operate, or maintain a charging station in its premises.

The charging stations installed in private and public buildings and establishments may be own—use charging stations
