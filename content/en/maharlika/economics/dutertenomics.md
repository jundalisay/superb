During his presidential campaign Duterte promised to give a comfortable life to the poor. However, the unstoppable rising prices* from 2020 directly contradict this promise since it makes life less comfortable.

> *This inflation can be most easily reduced by a global ban on cryptocurreny mining and NFTs as explained [here](/social/economics/solutions/2020-inflation) 



To see where the contradiction occurs, let's dissect Dutertenomics. Its most prominent parts are:

- Build Build Build
- TRAIN Law (This is higher taxation used to pay for Build Build Build)
- Ease of business
- Land Distribution
- Continuation of *Pantawid Pamilya* of Noynoy Aquino

These policies are consistent with the Keynesian doctrine, except for "Pantawid Pamilya" which is Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT), a modified version of Universal Basic Income (UBI) implemented by former President Noynoy Aquino.

CCT is a neoliberal policy* that [helps development banks](/social/economics/solutions/how-to-solve-inequality) such as the World Bank by giving employment to the bank's consultants and its money. 

> *The non-neoliberal, non-liberal financial way of poverty alleviation is called microfinance. The conservative way is welfare either by the state via social security or by religion via thites or forced donations.


Likewise, tech startups lobby for UBI to give employment to themselves via blockchain and other fancy new technologies, even if there might be no added benefit for the poor.  


<!-- *. This is proven by his original 10-point plan, as Dutertenomics. 

> *Hugo Chavez also implemented pro-poor policies which slowly drained away Venezuela's wealth until everyone became poor. For the Philippines, the huge 11 trillion peso debt certainly look like the first steps towards a similar destiny 
 -->
<!-- - allowing overseas Filipino workers to return in 2020 during the pandemic
  - This increased the Covid outbreak which crashed the economy. In contrast, Vietnam banned its own citizens from returning and was able to be Covid free in 2020
- the other policies of NEDA -->

<!-- Thus, Pantawid Pamilya is the first sign of policy inconsistency. Brazil's version is *Bolsa Familia* which was discontinued after it was proven that it had little effect on alleviating poverty.  -->

The original Dutertenomics itself is quite limited, so it also absorbed the NEDA* plan called **Ambisyon Natin 2040**. It was created by Arsenio Balisacan of the neoliberal Philippine Competition Commission during Noynoy Aquino's administration.

> *NEDA is the economic planning agency of the Philippine government. Ambisyon Natin 2040 is split into chunks called Philippine Development Plans, similar to Communist Five-Year Plans. The first plan is for 2017-2022. The next one is for 2023-2028.



## [Ambisyon Natin 2040](https://2040.neda.gov.ph/about-ambisyon-natin-2040): Neoliberalism Under the Guise of Socialism

This policy was formulated by interviewing 10,000 people around the nation, asking them what they and the country should achieve by 2040. Since the country is poor, then of course we can expect that the answers will reflect the shallow desires of poor people:
- 79% want a comfortable life
- 17% want a an affluent life

<!-- 'Comfortable life' is then defined as having:
- a medium-sized home (61%)
- a car (59%)
- college education (73%)
- local vacation (84%)
-->

It revealed that the uneducated wanted to study: <!-- An alarming trend is the national preference of subjects to study, with --> 
- teaching*
- business administration
- tourism
- law

> *Venezuela also spent a lot on teaching and social welfare through their Bolivarian programs, but is now dirt-poor. This is because we blindly expect teachers to teach the right things, not thinking that they could also teach the wrong things as well. 

<!-- This teaching of wrong things probably helped Maduro retain power, since governance and subordination are all based on opinion.  -->

Unfortunately, these subjects also lead to low-value services and employment (in red). Few people want to study the difficult subjects that lead to high value employment (in green).

{{< img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/neda2.jpg" alt="NEDA" >}}


Also alarming is the preference for cars over public transport such as buses and trains.

{{< img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/nedatrain.jpg" alt="NEDA Train" >}}



NEDA then built policies around this data:

- It added more road projects under the Build, Build, Build program instead of creating a proper state-owned bus system (NEDA, as a neoliberal agency, might never allow anything state-owned)
- It emphasized tourism and hospitality
<!-- - shortened business registration -->
- It ignored support for medical training and beefing up the healthcare system. Instead, it focused on the financial aspect of healthcare as health insurance through the Universal Healthcare Law<!--  which will drain the budget of 257 billion pesos --> <!-- which will need to be borrowed (utang) --><!-- this is probably from the 2010 nursing problem -->
- It focused on rice tariffication to allow imports <!-- while building up rice production --> in the guise of lowering food prices to benefit the poor. This is classic neoliberalism

As expected, these **backfired** when the unexpected pandemic hit:

- The lockdowns prevented people from travelling and from using the new roads from Build Build Build
- Tourism collapsed<!-- , rendering the public investment in it useless -->
<!-- - a lot of businesses closed down -->
- The lack of support for medical training led to a shortage of nurses, which made universal healthcare act irrelevant
- Rice tariffication led to agircultural imports that did not reduce rice prices, but instead destroyed local agriculture <!-- which created anomalies in rice supply -->
<!-- - , leading to the current high food prices -->


## The NEDA Flaw: A Reverse Kind of Survivorship Bias

The glaring error with the NEDA plan was that **it created economic policy from interviews with the people**. The problem is that a poor country like the Philippines will likely be full of poor people. **If you ask poor people what they want, then they will give answers that will propagate the same poverty**.

NEDA's mistake is a kind of [survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias)*.


{{< img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Survivorship-bias.svg/220px-Survivorship-bias.svg.png" >}}


> *Researchers in the UK in World War 2 observed that the returning British bombers had parts of their wings missing. The Americans wrongly advised that armor should be added to those parts. But Hungarian mathematician Abraham Wald argued the opposite, that armor should be added to the non-missing wing parts. The Americans were looking at the effect, while Wald was looking at the cause. 


An easy proof of this bias is the national preference for subjects like teaching, lawyering, tourism, and business administration that lead to low value jobs. Are Germany, Japan, South Korea known for their teachers, lawyers, tourism, or accountants? No. They're known for their advanced manfuacturing as Siemens, Hyundai, and Mitsubishi.

> *Tito Sotto is correct in saying that the country already has too many lawyers. Yet, public policy does nothing to discourage law schools or to make the bar exam more selective and restrictive <!--  the NEDA interview says that more people want to be lawyers than nurses. This is because nursing is hard work and low pay, while lawyering is easier. --> 


Another proof is the preference for cars over public transport. Did Japan, France, and Singapore solve their public transportation by allowing cars as a public policy? No. In fact, they had the opposite policy which oppressed car owners with high taxes and built subways and *shinkansen* instead of freeways. 

**By implementing policies that are OPPOSITE of what poor people want, the Japanese, Singaporeans, French, and Germans are actually able to have a more COMFORTABLE life.** 

**By implementing policies the poor people want, Venezuela and Brazil put themselves into POVERTY.** 


## More Proof of Ignorance of Policymakers

NEDA policy builds a lot of roads to address the demand for cars. They never think that if their policy succeeds then more people will actually own cars. **These cars will then flood the new roads to create new traffic jams!** 

<!-- and there will be traffic again -- all the huge debt for Build Build Build would have been for little gain --><!--  led to the same problem.  -->

If policymakers just let people have their way, then the nation will degenerate quickly with everyone buying cars, flocking to easy jobs, and no one* doing the difficult or low-paying ones. 

> *This is seen in the lack of local vaccine manufacturing, simply because only a few people ever wanted to study virology <!-- and have been brained drained -->
<!-- no one  -->

 <!-- Build Build Build construction projects being done by Chinese contractors instead of local ones, simply because few locals took the time and effort to learn new construction techniques, or have been brain-drained away -->

If everyone wants to be a singer, boxer, or online seller, then who will plant crops, build the power plants, do the medical services, or create vaccines?

If few people plant crops, build power plants, hospitals, and vaccines, then those goods and services will have a shortage.

If there is a shortage then their prices rise and there will be more Pharmally-style importation<!--  like  wherein foreigners use taxpayer money to buy Lamborghinis -->. 

If their prices rise then life would not be comfortable, violating the very goal of the policy.


Thus, **Ambisyon Natin 2040 naturally goes against itself**


Proof of this is **the collapse of the economy in 2020** which NEDA says is expected to recover only after 10 long years. They blame the pandemic instead of themselves. This is absurd since the economy of other countries are not so badly affected. Even poor Cuba, heavily embargoed by the US, is able to make Covid vaccines simply because the government encouraged more people to study difficult subjects.  

<!-- The only solution of NEDA and the Department of Finance is to borrow money -- **the same measure that Marcos took to fix the flawed policies of Virata and Ongpin**! -->

Ambisyon 2040 is still consistent with our earlier observation that [local policymakers, whether liberal 'dilawan' or nationalist 'loyalista', are ignorant of cause and effect](/maharlika/history/golden-years-marcos). This ignorance seemed to begin in the early 1960s after the presidency of Magsaysay* and Garcia who still had the right policies. 

> *Magsaysay for example fought against the pro-American Bell Trade act,  whereas Macapagal blindly accepted the pro-American decontrol policy of 1962. The decontrol destroyed local industrialization and allowed the country to get in debt with the IMF -- a practice carried to perfection by Marcos and Latin American dictators 

<!-- , even among the educated Virata, Ongpin, Purisima, Dominguez, Pernia, and Chua then lead to the wrong policies which then cause the country to stay largely poor from 1974 to 2021. -->

<!-- Just ask anyone if they are comfortable -->



## Evil Rice Tariffication

The Rice Tariffication Law is the single biggest mistake of the Philippine Development Plan 2017-2022 of Ambisyon Natin. It began with the rice crisis of September 2018 as the rapid increase in the prices of rice. But this was a natural consequence of the increased taxes from the TRAIN tax reform which was supported by NEDA itself.

{{< img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/farmer.jpg" alt="A farmer" >}}



Instead of strengthening NFA* to deal with the crisis, the Senate and Lower House actually destroyed it through the Rice Tariffication Law (RTL) in order to allow rice importation. 

{{< img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/icons/wtf.png" alt="nfa wtf" >}}

> *NFA is the National Food Authority which is the government agency that buys and stores rice 

The Masterminds of RTL were familiar names: 
- Cynthia Villar
- Grace Poe
- Joel Villanueva
- Jose Panganiban
- Kiko Pangilinan
- Leila de Lima
- Ralph Recto
- Risa Hontiveros
- Sharon Garin 
- Win Gatchalian
- [Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/money/economy/685184/arroyo-welcomes-signing-of-rice-tariffication-law/story/)
<!-- - Tomas Villarin
- Horacio Suansing Jr

<!-- Had Duterte dropped Duque during the pandemic, his approval ratings would not have dipped in 2020 and 2021. Duterte's unnecessary reliance on Arroyo is proof of her genius
 -->


The lawmakers thought, that by removing quotas and imposing a tiny 35% tariff that went to local farmers, local rice production would increase as to reduce the price of rice. 

In reality, the warehouses didn't bother buying from scattered local producers* and instead bought in bulk from a single importer, gaining from economies of scale. Without buyers for local rice, the local farmers had a glut of unsold rice. <!-- were already full of foreign rice and so the local rice could not be sold.  -->This is similar to local carrots not finding a market because the market was already occupied by Chinese carrots which could be bought by warehouses easily in bulk.


> *The error of the proponent of RTL was to apply [equilibrium theory (1.5 mb pdf)](https://www.phcc.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Issues-Paper-Rice-030819-cover-1.pdf) on a basic seasonal necessity such as rice. This is the same error that liberalized California's power industry as the energy spot-market, that led to their energy crisis. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo imported this scheme to create EPIRA that regularly brings power outages and price spikes.



Didn't the lawmakers know that the secret to rice and agricultural self-sufficiency is for the government to control all parts of the chain from production, transportation, milling, warehousing, wholesaling, and even exporting? 

Didn't they know that this is what Vietnam does with state-owned Vinafood which allows them to export rice cheaply to the world?

<!-- Didn't they know that the Philippines is among the largest rice importers in the world, and is Vietnam's biggest customer?  -->

Didn't they know that Marcos replicated this with the NFA (milling), Food Terminal Inc as FTI (storage), and Kadiwa stores (retail) which allowed the country to export rice in the past?


## The Problem with Neoliberal Keynesianism

These problems are really rooted in the flawed assumptions of Keynesianism which spread after the 2008 Financial Crisis. Because of the doctrine of profit maximization, the burden of driving growth fell to the government which had to build huge projects, get debt, then raise taxes to pay for that debt. 

In the case of Dutertenomics, TRAIN and food importation (Rice Tarrification) was used to pay for Build Build Build. It oppresses consumers and farmers to support the construction industry. It is not a growth that is inclusive nor balanced.


Our social cycles model predicts that the pandemic will last a long time, yet NEDA and lawmakers are still acting like the old normal. They have not scrapped their old neoliberal ways and still think that market forces will somehow relieve the people of their suffering.

Market forces cannot solve the current economic problems of the Philippines because such forces are based on **selfish-interest**, while the alleviation of the suffering of others is a **selfless-interest**. *A person, policy, or system cannot be selfish and selfless at the same time!*

Pharmally was able to buy Lamborghinis simply because it used the market forces of supply, demand, and financing to its private advantage, at the expense of a huge public debt which has to be paid by future generations. 

In fact, the pandemic has proven that nationalized basics* via semi-state-owned corporations are the way of the future, as proven by China and Singapore**. 

> *Healthcare, Power, Water, Telecoms, Public transportation

> **Singapore has the best healthcare in the world, with 80% of its people using government-owned hospitals, and the rest using private hospitals like Raffles Medical

Only the close coordination of various essential services can create a society strong enough to weather the shocks from global warming caused by the selfish <!-- winner-take-all --> behavior of market forces. This close coordination can only be done by the government which is supposed to have the public interest.

Our next post will explain how to implement this solution and overhaul Ambisyon 2040 into Maharlika 2050.   

<!-- Didn't they know that expensive infrastructure projects are only justified if  -->



<!-- Why did Duterte not veto this bill? Could it be because it was actually supported by his own NEDA which is infested with neoliberals?  -->

<!-- Why didn't he just use his military to arrest the smugglers and cartels citing economic sabotage? --> 

<!-- Could it be because he was ignorant of food policy in the same way that he was ignorant about Covid response and so he had to rely on 'health experts' such as the IATF which had flip-flopping policies*? -->

<!-- > *Miriam Defensor-Santiago filed Senate Bill 1573 "Pandemic and All-Hazards Prepareness Act" on September 5, 2013 but was ignored by the same despicable senate that made the Rice Tariffication Law -->



<!-- ## The Pandemic Will Make Neoliberalism Obsolete Eventually

The people **should avoid voting for those people who created the Rice Tariffication Law**. A quick workaround would be to:
- raise the tariffs to 700% like what Japan does, instead of the current 35% or 100%. Adam smith would call this 'taxation to the point of prohibition'
- use the tax revenue to rebuild NFA, FTI, and Kadiwa into a state-owned corporation directly under the executive or as an independent consitutional body
- remove neoliberals from policymaking that involves basic essentials. This would be more realistic if the NFA were a separate constitional body like the Comelec -->

<!-- Duterte won by landslide in 2016 thanks to his anti-drug and anti-corruption campaign. He promised to get rid of drugs and corruption in a few months, not knowing that [the country's metaphysics](/articles/metaphysics) actually caused those problems naturally.

His solution was to:
- weed out corrupt government officials by firing them, and
- eliminate the drug trade by killing the drug dealers and drug lords. 

These are shallow solutions that focus on the effect instead of the cause. Duterte never thought that:
- the corruption was created by the morals of American materialism which ascribed goodness to riches
- the drug trade was created by the desire for drugs which was encouraged by American liberalism

Proof is that during the Spanish times, the problem was only corruption, through the friars, (from the Spanish and the Church) and not drugs. This is because the Spanish imposed Catholic morals which empowered the Church, but went against drugs. South America was colonized by both Spain and America (Bay of Pigs, Nicaraguan Contras) and also have a corruption and drug problem much worse than the Philippines.

### Police Empowerment Without a Parallel Enforcement of Morality

Policies that only deal with effects, and not the cause, will require constant work by law enforcement. It would be like a boat with a leaky hull that is solved by scooping out the water instead of plugging the leaks. This explains why Duterte has to raise the salaries of the police and military to keep them working on the drug problem. 

The Roman Empire also did the same thing by raising the salaries of centurions and the Pretorian guards. This led to constant coups whenever the emperors couldn't raise them any longer. In fact, Rome had a year where they switched between five emperors! 

Liberals properly fear this and is why they are going against the anti-terror bill, as well as the empowerment given to the police and military. This fear is justified by the abuses of the police who kill people arbitrarily, such as the one who shot and killed a mother and her son on video in broad daylight. 

The only solution of Duterte is to blame those erring policemen as 'defects' of the Police Academy. At the moment, it is only Duterte's iron will that keeps the military and police from going back to their old corrupt ways*.

> *Crime and abuse are ultimately moral issues, to which our solution is a set of Constitutional Virtues. Britain also had a similar case wherein a police officer raped and killed a woman. This is proof that such a moral problem exists in rich and poor countries alike. 

After Duterte is gone, who will check an empowered military and police elite? -->
