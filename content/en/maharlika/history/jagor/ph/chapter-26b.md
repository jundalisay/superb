Invigorated by the severe struggle for existence which they have experienced in their own overpopulated country, the Chinese  preserved their capacity for labour perfectly unimpaired by any climate. 

No nation can equal them in contentedness, industry, perseverance, cunning, skill, and adroitness in trades and mercantile matters. 

When once they gain a footing, they generally appropriate the best part of the trade to themselves. 

In all parts of external India they have dislodged from every field of employment not only their native but, progressively, even their European competitors. 

Not less qualified and successful are they in the pursuit of agriculture than in trade. The emigration from the too thickly peopled empire of China has scarcely begun. 

As yet it is but a small stream, but it will by-and-by pour over all the tropical countries of the East in one mighty torrent, completely destroying all such minor obstacles as jealous interference and impotent precaution might interpose.

Over every section of remote India, in the South Sea, in the Indian Archipelago, in the Southern States of America, the Chinese seem destined in time either to supplant every other element, or to found a mixed race upon which to stamp their individuality. 

In the Western States of the Union, their number is rapidly on the increase. The factories in California are worked entirely by them, achieving results that cannot be accomplished by European labour.

- Both Chinese and Caucasians are there represented in their most energetic individuality*. 
- Every nerve will be strained in carrying on the struggle because no other country pays for labour at so high a rate.
- The conditions, however, are not quite equal. 
- The law places certain obstacles against the Chinese. 

The courts do not protect them sufficiently from insult, which at times is aggravated into malicious manslaughter through the ill-usage of the mob, who hate them bitterly as being reserved, uncompanionable workers. 

Nevertheless, the Chinese immigrants take their stand firmly. 


## INDUSTRY OF THE CHINESE

The western division of the Pacific Railway has been chiefly built by the Chinese. The engineers say that the Chinese surpass workers of all other nationalities in diligence, sobriety, and good conduct. 

What they lack in physical power they make up for in perseverance and working intelligently together. 

On April 28, 1869, 10 miles of railway track were laid in 11 working hours. <!-- along a division of --> <!-- The unique and nearly incredible performance. --> The rails, if laid in one continuous line, would measure about 103,000 feet, weighing 20,000 cwt. Eighteen Chinamen were engaged in the work, relieving one another by fours. These men were chosen to perform this feat on account of their particular activity, out of 10,000. Ordinarily, 8 Europeans were engaged in this extraordinary piece of work.

<!-- (This statement is incorrect, so far as the fact of the feat being accomplished by the Chinese 18 concerned. -->

During the rejoicings which took place in Sacramento upon the opening of the line, these 8 European men were paraded in a van, with the account of their splendid achievement painted in large letters on the outside. Certainly not one of them was a Chinaman.



* No single people in Europe can in any way compare with the inhabitants of California, which, in the early years of its existence, was composed only of men in the prime of their strength and activity, without aged people, without women, and without children. Their activity, in a country where everything had to be provided (no civilised neighbours living within some hundred miles or so), and where all provisions were to be obtained only at a fabulous cost, was stimulated to the highest pitch. Without here going into the particulars of their history, it need only be remembered that they founded, in 25 years, a powerful State, the fame of which has spread all over the world, and around whose borders young territories have sprung into existence and flourished vigorously; two of them indeed having attained to the condition of independent States. After the Californian gold-diggers had changed the configuration of the ground of entire provinces by having, with Titanic might, deposited masses of earth into the sea until they expanded into hilly districts, so as to obtain therefrom, with the aid of ingenious machinery, the smallest particle of gold which was contained therein, they have astonished the world in their capacity of agriculturalists, whose produce is sent even to the most distant markets, and everywhere takes the first rank without dispute. a Such mighty results have been achieved by a people whose total number scarcely, indeed, exceeds 500,000; and therefore, perhaps, they may not find it an easy matter to withstand the competition of the Chinese.

<!-- plished by Chinese workers. Only by them could it have been practicable.* -->

The Europeans are still superior in terms of the highest intellectual faculties. But, in all branches of commercial life in which cleverness and persevering industry are necessary, the Chinese are superior. To us, it seems that the influx of Chinese will kindle a struggle between capital and labour, in order to set a limit upon demands perceptibly growing beyond moderation.

The increasing Chinese immigration already raises questions of the utmost social and political importance in the minds of American statesmen. 

What influence will this entirely new and strange element exercise over the conformation of American relations? 

Will the Chinese found a State in the States? Or go into the Union on terms of political equality with the other citizens, and form a new race by alliance with the Caucasian element? 

These problems have been dealt with in a masterly manner by “Pumpelly," in his work “ Across America and Asia,” published in London in 1870.
