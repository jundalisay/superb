isten then while I narrate at length
The life of Lam-ang
Because his mother conceived him that month.

She did not abstain from any edible fruit:
Tamarind fruits tender and thin as bamboo strings,
Kamias, daldaligan,

Oranges and pomelos;
Butcher fish, stripped bass, fishes of all sorts;
Clams and bivalves big as plates,

Maratangtang and sea urchins;
Sea algae, aragan and arosip;
Shucked oysters, crayfish caught with net;

Blue crabs baited with salelem,
Deer tracked down and killed, boar trapped.
All of these she tasted on her eating binge.
Until Namungan, the woman Unnayan,
Wife of Don Juan Panganiban,
Was done conceiving.

And when they had made whole
A new soul,
Her womb grew bigger.
Listen, my husband Don Juan,
Go check on our bamboo groves
In the mountain of Capariaan.

Then make me my reclining bed
The bed I shall use
Right after giving birth.

Being God-given, my husband Don Juan,
The custom cannot be gainsaid.
So go cut me some mature bamboo shoots.

He prepared to leave and once there
Went around the grove.
Then he hailed the strong winds.

As well as the torrential rains
And cavernous clouds.
Lightning and thunder came in waves,

Hitting the groves again and again
Till it looked like the choicest shoots
Had been cut down by a trained bamboo cutter.

It is unseemly, such a shame
For me to carry you, bamboos.
They thus went ahead, Don Juan behind them.

Having reached the home he came down from,
In the town of Nalbuan,
The bamboos arranged themselves in the yard.

My husband Don Juan,
Let my reclining bed be of hardwood:
This part of molave and gastan;

That part of dangla and guava,
Whose barks have been skinned,
Then buy me a pot, husband Don Juan,

And a stove to heat my bath-water.
And a one-man pot too
For our child’s umbilical cord.

And having procured all these, he trekked
To the blackest mountain, upstream
To fight the Igorots there.

And when her time came
To deliver the blood made whole,
There was not one who was not called:

The masseuse-midwife, the fish-hooker, Alisot;
The diver Marcos; Pasho the rich man.
Since none of them could induce delivery

They remembered the woman
Shrivelled with age,
For she was known for her strong fingers.

The baby started to talk as soon as the
old woman delivered him.
Namungan, my mother,
Let my name be Lam-ang when you
have me baptized.


And let old man Guibuan be my godfather.
Mother, I must also ask you if I have a father;
Whether or not I arose like water vapor.

My son, Lam-ang; if it’s your father you speak of,
You were still in my womb when he left,
Left for the forest, the place of Igorot.

Lam-ang then said:
My mother Namungan, please let your son go,
For I would seek Father whom I came from.

Ah, son, brave-man Lam-ang,
Please don’t go.
For your legs are like bamboo string.
And your hands are like needles.
And you were born, my son,
Even before your ninth month inside me.

All the more brave-man Lam-ang still persisted.
He left for the forest, the place of Igorots.
For he wanted to see the father he sprang from.

For he had with him the stone of sagang,
The stone of tangraban, of lao-laoigan,
A wild carabao’s amulet.
When he passed by a grove of caña vernal,
The shoots bent down
For he also had the amulet of the centipede.

And having reached the river’s ford,
He spied the tallest tree around, a rancheria,
A landmark of tattooed Igorot country.

He cast his eyes around
And saw this root shaped like a stove
And went to wash his one-man pot.

And placed his food inside it,
The pot of mound-dwelling dwarves,
That cannot suffice for more than one traveller.

Having eaten his fill,
The man Lam-ang gratefully rested,
Amiable host to the food, the filling grace.

He rested his shield against his body;
Stuck his spear into the ground by his feet;
Unsheathed his trustworthy campilan from its sheath;

Then fell into a light sleep.
Then came the ghost of his father, saying:
My friends Lam-ang, go quickly instead;

Right now, they feast around you father’s skull.
Lam-ang was jolted out of his slumber
And at once collected his weapons and started to go,

Walking on and on.
Upon reaching the blackest mountain
At Maculili and Dagman,

He went directly to the assembled revelers.
For he had seen his father’s skull facing the East,
Caged in the woven end of a bamboo pole.

Tattooed Igorots, just tell me
What foul thing my father I came from did.
It is only right that it be paid.

Our friend Lam-ang,
It is only right; too,
That you go back to the house

You stepped down from.
Or else, You’ll be the next (to die)
After the man who was your father.

You tattooed Igorots…
I cannot be satisfied (with your number),
You Igorot captain,


You Bumacas so-named,
Communicate (thru a letter) with every single one,
(The members of your tribe):

At Dardarat and Padang,
There in houses at Nueva, Dagodong and Topaan,
There in Mamo-ocan and Caoayan,

There in Tupinao and Baodan,
Sumbanggue and Luya, Bacong and Sosoba.
There in Tebteb and Caocaoayan.

They came, having received these notes (from Bumacas),
In a rush, the tattooed Igorots,
From the neighboring towns nearby,

Like chicken attracted to grains thrown to the ground.
Oh, their number indeed was remarkable
For one cannot keep count of their number.

He then caressed his stone of lao-laoigan,
And jumped but once to an open field,
The man Lam-ang.

And the man Lam-ang made thunderclaps
With his armpits and thighs
As well as with both his arms.

Soon they had crowded around him…
As a moving river (of bobbing heads), so to speak…
The man Lam-ang.

And having completely surrounded him,
They cut loose on him with all their arms,
On the man Lam-ang.

Like a torrential rain at dusk,
The spears fell (thickly) on him,
The man Lam-ang.

He embraced these crisscrossing spears
As one would accept
Betel nuts passed on to him.

And when the tattooed Igorots had run out
Of sharpened bamboo poles, spears, lances,
But could not hit him even just once,

The man Lam-ang said to them:
Now comes my turn,
I unsheath you, campilan, trustworthy weapon.

He struck the ground with this.
And the earth with stuck to the blade of the campilan,
This he ate—

A stick of rice cake
So long and large—
So their incantations would not affect him

Tattooed Igorots, watch me closely now,
He beckoned to the south wind
And with it lunged at once at them.

As though felling down banana trunks,
His bolo bit into flesh two ways, swung left or right,
The man Lam-ang.

They were mowed down in an instant.
Only one tattooed Igorot was left unharmed,
Whom he mocked at, then pinned down.

Now comes your end.
He slashed at his mouth, his eyes;
Cut off his ears, arms and legs.

He then let him loose, the tattooed Igorot,
Who received no mercy at his hands.
That your relatives and tribe may all see you.

And you carabao’s amulet (help me)
For I now bind the lances and spears,
My booty and trophy from the Igorot.

And now I leave you battleground.
The blood flowed from the dead Igorots
Like the Vigan river.


He prepared to leave, the man
Lam-ang, and return,
To his mother Namungan.
And having reached the town of Nalbuan:

Mother Namungan, if I may ask,
What foulness he perpetrated,
The father I sprang from?

My son Lam-ang,
If it is your father your speak of,
We never quarrelled, not even once.

Mother Namungan, strike the longgan
That my younger sisters
May all come to my aid,

The maidens numbering twice nine,
Nine times nine.
That they may shampoo my curly locks

At the Amburayan River.
For it had become quite dusty,
During the day-long battle yesterday.

Mother Namungan,
Do let us pay a visit
To the old barn with molave posts,

Floored with derraan and polished bellaang.
And please ask them to sweep off the barn’s door,
The dead cockroaches, spiders, and their mess.

For nine years have passed
Since we last visited
Our palay called samusam,

Buan and laguingan,
Lumanus and lampadan,
Maratectec and macan, gaygaynet and balasang.

And having looked over the barn.
Young maidens, pull out the panicles
From each name (of rice variety).

And thresh these.
And what grains one accumulates thus
Is already hers to keep.

And this was done.
Young sisters, bind the straws.
Get also the coconut shell tong

And pick some embers with it.
And younger sisters, please,
Return the charcoal later,

For it is of paticalang wood.
At the Amburayan River we shall bathe.
At the riverbank,

He cast his eyes around and soon saw
The bubbles made by the crocodile.
My young sisters burn the rice straw.

Since the straw would not burn,
Lam-ang beckoned to the strongest wind—
And the straw burst into flames.

The people of San Juan were alarmed
By the sparks that reached them;
The people of Bacnotan ran

Thinking there was a conflagration.
And when they could not control the fire,
He beckoned to the torrential rain

And the cloud shaped like a precipice.
Lightning and thunder came in waves
And only then was the fire extinguished.


Younger sisters, please do not worry while waiting
For I’ll just swim awhile
And play with the largest crocodile.

Lam-ang dived into the river
Unaware that the crocodile
Had gone downstream,

While he went upstream.
And when he went downstream,
The crocodile went upstream,

They soon spotted each other
And began to fight.
Lam-ang became angry

And in one thrust subdued it.
Then, he carried it on his back,
And beached it,

Younger sisters, take its teeth for a necklace
For they can be amulets when one travels;
Younger sisters we must now return
To the house we came down from.

Mother Namungan please pay
The wages of these, my younger sisters,
A peso for each step, coming from and going back to the house.

And this having been done:
Mother Namungan, please open the second room.
And therefrom get my most valuable clothes.

I must change my clothes…
Into my striped trousers, embroidered shirt
And ornate handkerchief.

This done:
Please open also the third room
And take from there the gold.

Bulaoan of nine coils which breaks
When exposed to the sun
Whose heat is intense enough to sting one’s heel.

I am going to tie my white rooster,
Yellow-legged hen,
And my hairy dog.

For I am going to play at Calanutian
Where Doña Ines Cannoyan lives
As news has it…

A clean-living maiden
Who can spin nine spools overnight.
My son, brave-man Lam-ang,

Please don’t go yet
For you don’t look like one
Whom Doña Ines Cannoyan

Can fall in love with.
For her suitors are many
Including a number of Spaniards.

Yet she has not favored any of them
With even just a glance.
And look at you…

Can you be the one to win her love?
Mother Namungan, I must go.
I must enter the competition.

At the town of Calanutian,
Who knows, Doña Ines Cannoyan
May look on me with favor,

My son Lam-ang, if it’s a spouse you seek,
This town is full of nubile maidens.
And you can take your pick from them.




This is what the man Lam-ang said in turn:
Mother Namungan, of those you allude to,
I cannot choose anyone,

Not one of the maidens you speak of.
So please don’t detain me
For I must, will go.

My son Lam-ang, by God,
Please tarry longer.
For they may drench you.

With foul-smelling urine…
Spare yourself the embarrassment.
The white rooster then said,

As well as the yellow-legged hen:
Our mistress Namungan, we dreamt last night
That Doña Ines Cannoyan

Cannot help becoming your daughter-in-law.
Mother, please take out the oil
Just heated yesterday

So I may anoint my yellow-legged hen
And we may both look our best
When we go to the town of Calanutian.

Mother, please hand me
The nine coils of gold bulaoan.
And having received the gold coils,

He tied his white rooster
And his hairy dog as well.
And the task completed,

He prepared to leave.
He carried his cock, the yellow-legged rooster.
May God remain with you.

My son Lam-ang, God go with you;
Be careful, especially on your way there
Which you know to be more dangerous,

Having heard out the advice,
Lam-ang went his way
To Calanutian, the town of Doña Ines Cannoyan.

He walked untiringly
And midway to his destination,
Encountered the man Sumarang.

Whose eyes were big as plates
And whose nose was wide as two wheels.
This is what he at once said:

My friend, brave-man Lam-ang,
Where are you headed for?
Which forest do you intend to trap in?

Which mountain do you intend to hunt in?
My friend Lam-ang?
Replied Lam-ang:

My friend Sumarang, may I also ask
Where you came from—
The town, the locality you visited?

Said Sumarang:
Since you ask me, I came from the north,
The town of Calanutian.

I went there to compete
For the hand of Doña Ines Cannoyan.
Lam-ang said:

Where you came from
There I also intend to go,
With the same purpose, my friend Sumarang.


And he added:
My friend Sumarang,
We must now go our separate ways

For I must go now to Calanutian to compete—
Who knows, I may be chosen by Doña Ines Cannoyan.
You need not continue on your way

You cannot be, with your looks,
One Doña Ines Cannoyan can possibly choose.
So many rich men and Spaniards are there already

And Doña Ines Cannoyan has yet
To look out her window for anyone.
I say it again: it is futile

For you to continue your journey.
Sumarang (suddenly added):
Prepare your end

And try defending yourself
From my spear—
It will be too bad if you can’t catch

My hooked spear.
Said Lam-ang then:
Do what you will, I await your move.

Sumarang threw his spear
At his friend, Lam-ang
Lam-ang caught it

With his little and ring finger
As though it were betel nut
Proferred by a maiden.

Then
He twirled it nine times
Around his neck and body.

My friend Sumarang
I will return to you your spear
For I don’t want to be in your debt.

What you handed to me is too hot
Though its handle is cold
The handle of your spear.

My friend Sumarang
Now wait for its coming.
If you don’t beware,

Your corpse will be littered hereabout
By this weapon which now comes,
By your leave.

The brave-man Lam-ang,
He waved at the seawinds.
Then, simultaneously,

He let go of his spear.
The man Sumarang was flown by the spear
Across nine hills.

That’s how bad manners end up.
Friend Sumarang, now must I depart
From this, our battleground.

He carried his white rooster
And prepared to leave.
He had walked a long way

When he came across the house
Of the maiden Saridandan.
She said:

Older brother, do stop by.
Please hurry up
And let me embrace you.
