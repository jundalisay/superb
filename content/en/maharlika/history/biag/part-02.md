Lam-ang dived into the river unaware that:
- the crocodile had gone downstream while he went upstream
- when he went downstream the crocodile went upstream

They soon spotted each other and began to fight.

Lam-ang became angry and in one thrust subdued it.

Then, he carried it on his back and beached it,

Younger sisters, take its teeth for a necklace
For they can be amulets when one travels;
Younger sisters we must now return
To the house we came down from.

Mother Namungan please pay
The wages of these, my younger sisters,
A peso for each step, coming from and going back to the house.

And this having been done:
Mother Namungan, please open the second room.
And therefrom get my most valuable clothes.

I must change my clothes…
Into my striped trousers, embroidered shirt
And ornate handkerchief.

This done:
Please open also the third room
And take from there the gold.

Bulaoan of nine coils which breaks
When exposed to the sun
Whose heat is intense enough to sting one’s heel.

I am going to tie my white rooster,
Yellow-legged hen,
And my hairy dog.

For I am going to play at Calanutian
Where Doña Ines Cannoyan lives
As news has it…

A clean-living maiden
Who can spin nine spools overnight.
My son, brave-man Lam-ang,

Please don’t go yet
For you don’t look like one
Whom Doña Ines Cannoyan

Can fall in love with.
For her suitors are many
Including a number of Spaniards.

Yet she has not favored any of them
With even just a glance.
And look at you…

Can you be the one to win her love?
Mother Namungan, I must go.
I must enter the competition.

At the town of Calanutian,
Who knows, Doña Ines Cannoyan
May look on me with favor,

My son Lam-ang, if it’s a spouse you seek,
This town is full of nubile maidens.
And you can take your pick from them.




This is what the man Lam-ang said in turn:
Mother Namungan, of those you allude to,
I cannot choose anyone,

Not one of the maidens you speak of.
So please don’t detain me
For I must, will go.

My son Lam-ang, by God,
Please tarry longer.
For they may drench you.

With foul-smelling urine…
Spare yourself the embarrassment.
The white rooster then said,

As well as the yellow-legged hen:
Our mistress Namungan, we dreamt last night
That Doña Ines Cannoyan

Cannot help becoming your daughter-in-law.
Mother, please take out the oil
Just heated yesterday

So I may anoint my yellow-legged hen
And we may both look our best
When we go to the town of Calanutian.

Mother, please hand me
The nine coils of gold bulaoan.
And having received the gold coils,

He tied his white rooster
And his hairy dog as well.
And the task completed,

He prepared to leave.
He carried his cock, the yellow-legged rooster.
May God remain with you.

My son Lam-ang, God go with you;
Be careful, especially on your way there
Which you know to be more dangerous,

Having heard out the advice,
Lam-ang went his way
To Calanutian, the town of Doña Ines Cannoyan.

He walked untiringly
And midway to his destination,
Encountered the man Sumarang.

Whose eyes were big as plates
And whose nose was wide as two wheels.
This is what he at once said:

My friend, brave-man Lam-ang,
Where are you headed for?
Which forest do you intend to trap in?

Which mountain do you intend to hunt in?
My friend Lam-ang?
Replied Lam-ang:

My friend Sumarang, may I also ask
Where you came from—
The town, the locality you visited?

Said Sumarang:
Since you ask me, I came from the north,
The town of Calanutian.

I went there to compete
For the hand of Doña Ines Cannoyan.
Lam-ang said:

Where you came from
There I also intend to go,
With the same purpose, my friend Sumarang.


And he added:
My friend Sumarang,
We must now go our separate ways

For I must go now to Calanutian to compete—
Who knows, I may be chosen by Doña Ines Cannoyan.
You need not continue on your way

You cannot be, with your looks,
One Doña Ines Cannoyan can possibly choose.
So many rich men and Spaniards are there already

And Doña Ines Cannoyan has yet
To look out her window for anyone.
I say it again: it is futile

For you to continue your journey.
Sumarang (suddenly added):
Prepare your end

And try defending yourself
From my spear—
It will be too bad if you can’t catch

My hooked spear.
Said Lam-ang then:
Do what you will, I await your move.

Sumarang threw his spear
At his friend, Lam-ang
Lam-ang caught it

With his little and ring finger
As though it were betel nut
Proferred by a maiden.

Then
He twirled it nine times
Around his neck and body.

My friend Sumarang
I will return to you your spear
For I don’t want to be in your debt.

What you handed to me is too hot
Though its handle is cold
The handle of your spear.

My friend Sumarang
Now wait for its coming.
If you don’t beware,

Your corpse will be littered hereabout
By this weapon which now comes,
By your leave.

The brave-man Lam-ang,
He waved at the seawinds.
Then, simultaneously,

He let go of his spear.
The man Sumarang was flown by the spear
Across nine hills.

That’s how bad manners end up.
Friend Sumarang, now must I depart
From this, our battleground.

He carried his white rooster
And prepared to leave.
He had walked a long way

When he came across the house
Of the maiden Saridandan.
She said:

Older brother, do stop by.
Please hurry up
And let me embrace you.
