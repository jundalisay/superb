<!-- Current cuisine, referenced with Pigafetta's records show what are the essential ingredients of Maharlikan food -->


An important advoacy of Maharlikanism is the introduction of Maharlikan food as an alternative to the unhealthy Filipino food. The latter is made up of meats and oils from Spanish influence, as well as salty condiments from Chinese influence. 

## Spanish and Chinese Food

From Spain:
- Adobo
- Mechado
- Caldereta
- Lechon
- Chorizo
<!-- - Kare kare -->
- Longanisa
- Beef Tapa
- Sisig (from American pork excess)

{{< img src="/photos/food/adobopork.jpg" alt="Adobo" cap="Philippine Adobo is full of cholesterol and oils, keeping heart disease and high healthcare costs near" >}}

From China:
- Soy sauce
- Fish sauce
- Pancit
- Mami
- Misua


The meaty and oily Spanish influence leads to heart problems, while the salty Chinese influence lead to kidney problems. These then matches the high trend in hypertension, heart problems and the need for dialysis among Filipinos (as to be a target of a Philhealth scam).

The worst food of these are Pork Adobo and Lechon which are full of heavy fats and oils. These are not natural to Maharlikan bodies or islander bodies which are used to seafood, vegetables, and fowl-meat.

To preserve Maharlikan health, we **declare war on Adobo** and such unhealthy Spanish-influenced food, and the overuse of soy and fish sauce (patis). Instead, we advocate healthier Maharlikan food which are made up of the following ingredients:

<!-- The writings of Pigafetta on the produce of Maharlika show what would make up Maharlikan food: -->

Item | Flavor or Nutrition
--- | ---
Seafood| Protein, Fish oils
Birds (Chicken, Peacock, etc)  | Protein
Pork | Protein
Veal | Protein
Coconut | Creaminess
Coconut vinegar | Sourness
Banana | Sweetness
Chili | Hotness
Ginger* | Spices


> *Ginger is the spice that seems to be common in both Maharlikan and Filipino food

Each tray contained 12 porcelain dishes full of veal, capons, chickens, peacocks, and other animals, and fish. We supped on the ground upon a palm mat from 32 different kinds of meat besides the fish and other things.

As you can see, Maharlikan food focus on local rootcrops, vegetables, spices, and fruits, plus a diversity of meats. 


## Sinigang: Truly Maharlikan

The best example of Maharlikan food is sinigang, which is a sour dish using fish, chicken, or vegetables. This is much healthier than adobo and is easier to digest. It emphasizes the **Maharlikan sourness** * as opposed to Indian hotness, or Chinese saltiness.

When they wish to make vinegar, they allow only the coconut water to putrefy, and then place it in the sun. A vinegar results like that made from white wine.

Nutritionists advocate rainbow-colored food and it's easy to see how much more colorful sinigang is than adobo. Because of its good points, it's also easy to understand why sinigang was voted as the world's best vegetable soup by [Taste Atlas](https://www.tasteatlas.com/sinigang) in 2021.


### Other Maharlikan Food

Other examples of Maharlikan food are:

- Ginataan
- Tinola, Nilaga
- Atchara
- Laing
- Daing
- Paksiw, Kinilaw (Vinegar again)
- Inihaw (Roasted)

After a half-hour a platter of roast fish cut in pieces was brought in, and ginger freshly gathered, and wine.

Maharlika had close ties with other Asian countries and so we can adopt other Asian food as Maharlikan food, provided that they use the native ingredients listed above. These include:

- Lumpia
- Kare-kare and Curry (Indian spice influence)
