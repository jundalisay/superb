If human perfection is a 100% score The educated humans think that humanity is around 80% and perfection is near. 

In reality, humans are only at 35%. The re-discovery and initial use of the aether will be the marker for the 50% mark. This is similar to the discovery of electromagnetism as electricity being the entry to the 30% score. The discovery of and manipulation of spacetime, as action at a distance and the teleportation and levitation of masses will be the 40% mark. The total mastery of all of these would be 100% mark. At that point, humans will transition into another species that is no longer purely material in nature, but one that can switch from matter to light and light to matter. This latter is similar to human street performers who act as statues (material non-living objects) at public areas. We can act like rocks and stay immobile all day -- but it doesn't make sense. Similarly, light-beings can downgrade themselves into physical beings, but it won't make sense. Accordingly, it rarely happens and such occurences really expose problems with such light-beings just as we would call a man who acted like a statue as weird.

<div class="panel">
<small>* Truth is the equivalence of a metaphysical idea with its physical reality or perception. Both the idea of unicorns and of God, as a giant man in the sky, have no equivalent physical existence. Yet most religions believe in such a giant floating God because such an idea serves to <i>awe</i> humans and <b>puts their relatively small ego in check</b>. This then fulfills the goal of private morality as mentioned in the previous chapter, something that a belief in unicorns cannot achieve. Instead of using truth as what the Indians did, or of using the idea of an all-powerful Allah as what the Prophet Mohammad did, Confucius chose to check human ego through rigid rituals and by saving face.</small>

Oxford, China, Cuba, and Russia didn't need any free market prize system. They had a need, found some capable researchers, and funded them. Simple. No need for AMC for development. They then found friendly countries to export those vaccines to. No need for AMC for mass production. 

The failure of the AMC model is proven by the shortcomings of COVAX -- because the prize-givers wanted the prize for themselves and there is no higher authority (i.e. world government) to police the prize givers. 

Did Gan's advocate for a world government to regulate AMCs? No he did not.

The failure of Prout to be established from the 1990s to the 2010s manifests as the world having no solution to the current stagflation.

Its principles decree "maximum utilization", "rational distribution", and "proper adjustment", but do not explain how they will actually be done in reality. 

This is because its founder thought like a deity who could materialize things by will. Yes, the principles are sound, but those are only true at the end phase where everything has been perfected. 

It would be like an 17th century inventor having a vision for a motorcycle and then starting work immediately a motorcycle when the combustion engine hasn't even been invented yet. The project would be guaranteed to fail.  

The correct way is to start with a bicycle and then to perfect it step by step until it becomes a perfected motorcycle. 

This is how Soichiro Honda started with making metal-spoked wheels in 1928 to replace wooden spokes. He then made bicycles, and then bicycle motors, which then evolved to become motorcycles. 

Similarly, the principles of Prout require a barter system which starts off as an exchange platform that will let people get services. 

This will then evolve into an employment system that matches the Buddhist system of 'right livelihood' that is in line with one's dharma. This matches Prout Principle 3.

This will then lead to Buddhist Economics which prioritizes the well-being of all entities, matching the principle of minimum requirements and Prout Principle 2.

This will lead to reduced consumption, less waste, and less energy use, matching Prout Principles 4 and 5

These will then lead to less exploitation whether of humans or plants and animals, matching Prout Principle 1

The base or starting point of Prout is therefore the barter system, just as the starting point of Honda's motorcycles were metal-spoked wheels. 

Ask any Proutist how they will implement and scale a barter system globally, they will reply with a blank stare. This is why Prout is currently nowhere.  

We solve this through a scalable barter system that can work online or offline and package it as non-dogmatic Buddhist Economics. 

https://superphysics.org/research/schumacher/buddhist-economics/part-2



The flaw of Prout is that it starts off with the end goal or intended result. 


1. No individual can accumulate any physical wealth without the clear approval of the collective body.
2. There should be maximum utilization and rational distribution of all mundane, supramundane and spiritual potentialities of the universe.
3. There should be maximum utilization of physical, metaphysical and spiritual potentialities of unit and collective bodies of human society.
4. There should be a proper adjustment amongst these physical, metaphysical, mundane, supramundane and spiritual utilizations.
5. The method of utilization should vary in accordance with changes in time, space and person, and the utilization should be of progressive nature.

This      

are the end effect.

The middle and upper classes, if they understand their own interest, should always oppose all taxes on necessities and direct taxes on the wages of labour. The final payment of such taxes all fall on themselves, with a big overcharge.

<!-- This instinct of self-preservation in turn is based on Nature's law of having diversity and **protecting** that diversity through metaphysical and physical means. This is easily seen in a rainforest where diversity is at its highest.
- The richness of a forest allows a lot of plants which allows a lot of animals.
- These animals allow "predator" species which limit the expansion of the animals in order to protect the plants. 

Having no predators will allow the animals to overrun the plants and make the area barren, like in pastures overrun by herds of deer and cattle.

A person who is ignorant of this Law of Nature will see predators as evil and dangerous. With this corrupted moral sense, he will try to kill all predators so that all prey can be free. The prey will then create an imbalance and overrun the lower lifeforms supporting the ecosystem, causing a decline for all.  

On the other hand, a person who prefers predation will encourage their growth by making prey easier to kill. For example, he could funnel their migration routes into ambush zones through wire-fences. This would create a boom in predator population which will then fight each other for the few remaining prey, leading to a similar decline for all.     


### The Four Dominant Mentalities

Thus, the ecosystem of human society has predators or alpha males that keep the people in check for the sake of a sustainable social order. There are four alpha male types as dominant mentalities:

Superphysics Name | Socratic Name | Hindu Name
--- | --- | ---
Populist | Democrat | Shudra
Militant | Tyrant | Ksattriya
Philosopher | Aristocrat "The Best" | Brahmin
Merchant | Oligarch "Rule by Possessions" | Vaeshya  


Two of these band together to defeat the other two. This bi-party tendency seems to be a quirk of the human species and is seen in:
- pros vs cons
- benefit vs cost
- Republican vs Demcrat
- Capitalist vs Communist

A more advanced species would be able to think of a third perspective so that a middle ground would also exist:
- pros vs compromise vs cons
- benefit vs need vs cost
- Republican vs Bipartisan vs Demcrat
- Capitalist vs Non-aligned vs Communist -->
